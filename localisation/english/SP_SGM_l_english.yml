#WLSR Conferences
sgm.1.t:0 "WLSR Holds Conference in Salzburg"
sgm.1.d:0 "In 1921, German physician and sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld organized the First Congress for Sexual Reform, leading to the formation of the now comintern-backed Weltliga für Sexualreform - World League for Sexual Reform. Since 1928, the organization has held congresses each year, headed by numerous leading figures in the field of medicine and sociology advocating policy and social reforms regarding sexual rights and the acceptance of homosexual and transgender people (now known under an umbrella term as SGM - Sexuelle und Geschlechtsspezifische Minderheit (Sexual and Gender Minorities)). The organization advocates a ten-point platform which lists:\n\n1. Economic, political, and sexual equality of men and women\n\n2. Secularization and reform of laws on marriage and divorce\n\n3. Birth control to make birth voluntary and responsible\n\n4. Eugenic birth selection (Note: Most likely referring to hereditary diseases)\n\n5. Protection of unmarried mothers and 'illegitimate children'\n\n6. Rational understanding of intersex people and homosexuals.\n\n7. Comprehensive sex education\n\n8. Reforms to eliminate the dangers of prostitution\n\n9. Treating sexual abnormalities medically, rather than 'as crimes, vices or sins'\n\n10. Legalization of sexual acts between consenting adults, while criminalizing sexual acts without consent, or acts upon minors and the mentally disabled.\n\nThis year's conference was held in Salzburg November 20-26, and went on as planned. The WLSR is seeking to broaden its horizons and promote its ideas beyond the borders of the FSRD and USSR, where it enjoys most of its support."

#Yugoslavia
sgm.yugo.1.t:0 "WLSR Urges Establishment of a Branch in Yugoslavia"
sgm.yugo.1.d:0 "Yugoslavia has relatively stabilized, and the socialist government has brought prosperity and stability throughout the country. Despite all of this and the constant efforts of communist and feminist organizations in every corner of the land, large parts of it are still practically centuries backwards in terms of social equality and worldview.\n\nAnd so, it came as a shock to many and to the dismay to some that the World League for Sexual Reform - the comintern's hand in promoting the rights of gender and sexual minorities abroad - had pressed us to allow them to establish a branch specifically operating on our territory.\n\nRegardless of the conservative society, the KPJ, and particularly the followers of the more progressive pro-Đilas faction, is fairly in favor of this, inspired by the FSRD's and USSR's moves to legalize homosexuality. If we are to give this proposed organization, named the 'Society for the Integration of Sexual Minorities' (Društvo za Integraciju Seksualnih Manjina - DISM) a place in this country, where shall it be?"
sgm.yugo.1.a:0 "In Belgrade, the biggest city and core of the country!"
sgm.yugo.1.b:0 "In Ljubljana, the capital most developed and closest to the west!"
