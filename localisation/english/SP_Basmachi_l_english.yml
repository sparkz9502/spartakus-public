Basmachi_raiding.1.t:0 "A Successful Raid"
Basmachi_raiding.1.desc:0 "Our raiders advanced towards the clearly unprepared enemy in the cover of night. Shocked, their fighters were cut down with ease and those who remained were forced to flee for their lives. Much equipment was left behind, including rifles, ammunition, horses and personal belongings. Our raiders will scavenge the battlefield, raid the local towns and then return home triumphantly."

Basmachi_raiding.3.t:0 "A Costly Raid"
Basmachi_raiding.3.desc:0 "Our raiders advanced towards the enemy, who although prepared were overcome with a bit of strategy. Still, their fighters fought well and killed some of our men. Our raiders captured some of the enemy supplies but were counterattacked before they could seize the rest. This is no doubt a victory, albeit a costly one, and raiding the nearby towns is out of the question."
