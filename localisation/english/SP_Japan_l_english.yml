## Intro Events ##

jap.1.t:0 "The Empire of Japan"
jap.1.d:0 "While Japan saw little conflict in the Great War proper, the aftermath drew Japan in enormously. Concerns over the Russian Revolution lead Japan to occupy much of the Russian Far East. From this point onwards the Japanese political scene would become increasingly polarized between liberal urbanites and the benefactors of the Taisho Democracy on one hand, and the increasingly frustrated Japanese Army, Navy, aristocracy and colonial administration and population on the other hand. \n\nThe booming postwar economy saw social harmonization after the chaotic Meiji period, leading to the acceptance of socialist thought in public discourse and a succession of liberal or socially democratic governments. Universal male suffrage came in 1923, and women were granted first the right to attend political meetings in 1921 - the subsequent blossoming of women's political consciousness lead to the extention of the franchise to Japan's female population in 1928. Just as the Meiji Restoration had overseen the transformation of a country from feudalism in a single generation, it seemed that the Taisho Era would play the same role for Japan's cultural evolution.\n\nHowever parallel to this was, in a sense, another Japan. The Army remained dug in over freezing Siberian winters, in their mind thanklessly safeguarding the nation from Bolshevist invasion, only to see it crumble from within. This frustration was shared in the Navy, who found themselves involved in numerous anti-communist interventions along the major cities of the Chinese coast, and in 1922 assisted the British Navy with the suppression of a communist Sailor's Revolt in Singapore. While the Japanese Army withdrew from Siberia for the most part in 1926, many of these veterans were then transferred to the Kwantung Army in Manchuria. This posting soon became an incubator for a growing ecosystem of ultranationalist secret societies, think-tanks and officer's groups. Growing colonial unrest, now empowered by a new ideology, frustrated the governors there, while the dying Genrō who had overseen Japan's affairs since the Restoration found themselves losing control to a new generation of liberally-minded urbanites.\n\nThe country has an unclear path ahead. With the death of the Taisho Emperor and the ascendance of the Showa Emperor in 1930, it will seem the 'two Japans' that fractured during the last Emperor's reigns must either reconcile, or one will beat the other out."
jap.1.a:0 "How are we doing diplomatically?"
jap.1.b:0 "Tennōheika Banzai!"

jap.6.t:0 "The Empire of Japan"
jap.6.d:0 "On the world stage, Anglo-Japanese relations prospered to the detriment of both countries' relations with the United States. British sponsorship saw Japanese successes internationally with the Racial Equality Proposal and a number of naval armament conferences that saw Japan ranked as a first-rate world power along with the US and Britain. These developments did much to ameliorate much anti-west sentiment even in Japan's more reactionary circles, instead implanting the nationalist intelligensia with a focused anticommunism and also a sense that the United States was more concerned with stifling Japan's imperial destiny than staunching the red terror."
jap.6.a:0 "Excellent."

## 1932 Election ##

jap.8.a:0 "We just about made it."

## Events ##

jap.2.t:0 "Sakuradamon Incident"
jap.2.d:0 "As the Emperor was departing the Imperial Palace on a frosty winter morning, headed to review a military parade, terror struck. A young man, while disgused as a military policeman threw a grenade with the intent of assassinating the Emperor - luckily the grenade missed, and only killed two horses. Pulling the Korean Taegukgi from his jacket, he yelled three times 'Long Live Korean Independence!' before being apprehended by police. Upon interrogation it was learned he was acting as a member of the Patriotic Legion, a Korean terrorist movement under the thumb of the exiled government."
jap.2.a:0 "Thank heavens the Emperor is alright."

jap.4.t:0 "Omori Bank robbery"
jap.4.d:0 "On the 6th October 1932, three members of the Japanese Communist Party entered the Kawasaki Bank in the Omori district of Tokyo. The party was in dire financial straits after having lost the main source of it's funding from Chinese benefactors out of Shanghai the following year, now getting by solely on membership fees and donations, even trying to open a dance hall in Tokyo to raise some money. In these conditions three ambitious members of the JCP launched a spectacular heist in the middle of Tokyo, making off with ¥32,000.\n\nWith the perpetrators still at large, the sheer boldness of the act has captured the attention of the media and the country. However there may be political uses for this particular stunt as well. While the JCP Central Committee are vehemently denying either knowledge or condonement of the robbery, conservative agitators in the police & armed forces and even some members of our own government are arguing that we should be capitalising on this to shut down the Communist Party movement."
jap.4.a:0 "Leave it be, they've made fools of themselves enough already."
jap.4.b:0 "We should take advantage of this."

jap.5.t:0 "Shirokiya Department Store Fire"
jap.5.d:0 "On a cold morning in downtown Tokyo, an electrical fault lead to a tremendous fire in the Shirokiya Department Store, which soon engulfed the entire building. The staircase running through the centre of the building, instead of providing a main route of escape, quickly became a chimney for the smoke, providing oxygen to spread the fire even further. Many of those inside jumped from windows to be caught by firefighters, and as many as eighty people escaped via improvised ropes made from clothing & curtains. Unfortunately however, even with these miraculous escapes, fourteen people perished in the fire and nearly seventy were gravely injured."
jap.5.a:0 "Awful!"
