POLITICS_FENG_YUXIANG_DESC:0 "§GDate of Birth:§! §g6 November 1882§!\n§GPlace of Birth:§! §gCangzhou, Hebei§!\n§GOverview:§! §gFeng Yuxiang's career in the military goes as far back as age 11 in which he enlisted at the lowest rank in the Qing Army with no pay. After years of hard work, he would be transferred into the newly formed Beiyang Army in 1902. Over time, opposition to the Qing began developing in Feng and in the later portion of the Xinhai Revolution, Feng participated by fighting the Qing government with local revolutionaries in Luanzhou. This was a major turning point in Feng's life. The local revolution in Luanzhou was suppressed and Feng was imprisoned. He would later rejoin the Beiyang Army in 1914. These events would shape Feng's character in the fact that on one hand, he wished to participate in a revolution, but on the other he did not know how to lead a revolution. This would later be reflected in the Beijing Coup of 1924 in which he was able to surprise the incumbent warlords, but hesitation led to him failing and being forced to flee into Northwest China.\n\nLuckily, his simple patriotism together with the CPC's efforts finally helped guide him to the right path to the art of revolution. After the Wuyuan Pledge, he joined his troops with the National Revolutionary Army, and got revenge against the Beiyang warlords in the Northern Expedition. Through this event, he was able to prove himself and his army as an indispensable force in China. Not only did the Wuhan and Nanjing governments wish to draw Feng to their side, even the Soviets also were considering Feng as the key to the revolution of China.\n\nNonetheless, it is widely known that Feng has little interest in ideology due to his contradictions. He was once a Buddhist but then later became a Christian. He claimed to believe in communism yet joined the KMT rather than the CPC. Any action that could be beneficial to his army would be done by him. He has long claimed that he is trying to lead the Guominjun to a 'Glorious Future', but did he actually know how to achieve it - or, furthermore, does he even truly have such an ambition?"

### Events ###
KMC.1.t:0 "An Overstretched Warlord"
KMC.1.d:0 "To most citizens, the Guominjun now enjoys its best times since the Beijing Revolution in 1924: Northwestern China is firmly held by the Guominjun, with the largest army in China at its defense. When the southern KMT-led government split and fell into chaos, the Guominjun managed to maintain peace and order in its territories. Observers predict that a war will erupt between the Wuhan and Nanjing governments, and they are quite sure that the Guominjun will stand firm this time, and perhaps play a far more vital role compared to the Northern Expedition.\n\nYet under the surface, there are great problems for the Guominjun. Northwestern China is not wealthy, and the war added a burden to the economy. The economic problems are so serious that Feng Yuxiang has had to consider disarmament to relieve costs. Nonetheless, it is hard for him to make such a choice, for some of the provinces have questionable loyalties, especially Qinghai and Gansu, where Ma Bufang demands exceeding power for himself and his clique. Additionally, the Zhensongjun is a source of trouble, as this bandit-like clique we absorbed is blamed for poor discipline in Henan and Shaanxi. They are likely to rebel against us if we try to restrict their power. If we manage to restrict these troops, we might be able to save the economy, yet these troops may be used against us by our enemies, especially Yan Xishan in the east. His vague attitude towards the revolution and our conflicts in Hebei province makes him a potential enemy. Though we could crush him in any normal situation, if we are occupied with internal crisis he may find an opportunity to strike."
KMC.1.a:0 "We shall delay no more."

KMC.2.t:0 "Absorb the Northwestern Army?"
KMC.2.d:0 "The Northwestern Army led by Yang Hucheng and Jing Yuexiu has been long rooted in Shaanxi Province. They have been a tough enemy of the Beiyang Government, and are known for their loyalty to the revolutionary ideals of Xinhai Revolution.\n\nIn the past few years, they had been a trustworthy ally of us. They helped us in crushing the Zhensongjun threat and stabilized Shaanxi in our darkest ages. All was not pleasant, however, for relations were soured when Feng Yuxiang killed one of their most capable generals, Guo Jian. Those turbulent ages did not allow a compromise, and reconciliation has yet to come. Now, they are relevant in the disarmament issue, as we'll have to consider whether to keep them as a branch of the Guominjun or not. Although keeping them as an ally may not succeed in achieving reconciliation, disarming them will most certainly harm relations even further."
KMC.2.a:0 "The Northwestern Army will always be a trustworthy ally."
KMC.2.b:0 "You know, we are in hard times..."

KMC.3.t:0 "Reintegrate 2nd Army of the Guominjun?"
KMC.3.d:0 "The 2nd Army of the Guominjun had once ruled Henan Province after the Beijing Coup in 1924, when the Soviet advisors approved them and the Marshall Hu Jingyi as reliable allies of Chinese Revolution. No one had expected that Marshall Hu would die suddenly from illness the following year, and that Wu Peifu together with the Zhensongjun would take revenge on them. Henan was lost and the 2nd Army of the Guominjun was at the edge of collapse.\n\nWe had once promised to rebuild the 2nd Army of the Guominjun, but the burdened state of the economy will not allow us to rebuild such a grand army. Now we have two options: continue rebuilding the 2nd Army at the expense of the economy, or integrate these forces into existing divisions."
KMC.3.a:0 "Continue the rebuilding plan."
KMC.3.b:0 "Integrate them into existing formations."

KMC.4.t:0 "Recognize the Zhensongjun?"
KMC.4.d:0 "The Zhensongjun had not only been our enemy, but also the enemy of Northwestern Army led by Yang Hucheng, and also the terror of the people in Shaanxi and Henan. They used to be loyal to Wu Peifu, but both were crushed during the Northern Expedition. Some of the generals of Zhensongjun sweared loyalty to us, and did help us in following wars. However, those bandit-like troops are also blamed for their poor discipline, which is a major problem for our governance.\n\nThe disarmament issue could be used as an excuse to get rid of this infamous clique in its entirety, but some have suggested maintaining the loyal elements while purging the poorly behaved elements. Shall we recognize the Zhensongjun, at risk of enraging their enemies within us, or purge them entirely?"
KMC.4.a:0 "We should make use of them."
KMC.4.b:0 "Expel them, all of them!"

KMC.100.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Feng Yuxiang Secures Northern China"
KMC.100.d:0 "Surprising reports have reached us from Beiping. General Feng Yuxiang has forced Yan Xishan to place his troops and regions under the control of the Guominjun.\n\nBefore that, Feng's Guominjun was already the largest among all Chinese armies. As Feng has successfully dominated Northern China, his influence has greatly increased. Based on this, some even believe that the Guominjun will replace the chaotic KMT and weak CPC.\n\nNevertheless, there are many intellectuals still think that Guominjun does not have all the qualities needed to completely unify China. But it’s clear that the Guominjun will play a more important role in China’s future political situation, regardless of other opinions."
KMC.100.a:0 "Inter caecos luscus rex."

KMC_expel.1.t:0 "Zhensongjun exilers arrive"
KMC_expel.1.d:0 "General Liu Mao'en together with his subordinates have approached us, claiming that they had been expelled by Feng Yuxiang from the Guominjun. Now they wish to bring their Zhensongjun remnants to fight for us. They could be a help in the upcoming Nanjing-Wuhan war, yet they are so infamous that some of our officers suggest to not accept this bandit-like clique. What should we do?"
KMC_expel.1.a:0 "We need the help."
KMC_expel.1.b:0 "It is too risky."

###Focus
KMC_overstreched_warlord:0 "Overstretched Warlord"
KMC_overstreched_warlord_desc:0 "Though the Guominjun has the largest army in China, the economy is unable to support such a grand army anymore. Feng will have to engage in disarmament to save the economy. Yet, this issue is highly complicated. The Guominjun is divided between many factions, and disarming them may lead to internal instability."
KMC_northwest_army_problem:0 "Absorb the Northwestern Army?"
KMC_northwest_army_problem_desc:0 "The Northwestern Army, or Xibeijun, is an old acquaintance to us. They helped to establish our rule in Shaanxi, but are rather independent compared to our own troops. It may be wise to absorb them as a standard part of the army, but we also may not be able to support such a move economically."
KMC_2nd_army_of_KMC:0 "Reintegrate 2nd Army of Guominjun?"
KMC_2nd_army_of_KMC_desc:0 "The 2nd Army of the Guominjun, or Guomin Er jun, was first established before the Beijing coup in 1924, and was unfortunately crushed by Zhili Clique. Some of their generals and soldiers managed to evacuate and fight with us during the Northen Expedition, and we had decided to rebuild their division. Now the economy cannot fully support the rebuilding plan, and we must decide whether to continue these plans in some form or to integrate the remnants into existing formations."
KMC_Zhensongjun_problem:0 "Recognize the Zhensongjun?"
KMC_Zhensongjun_problem_desc:0 "The Songxian Pacification Force, or Zhensongjun, was once an ally of the Zhili Clique. When they were defeated, some of them joined us. While they have fought on our side, their poor discipline had long bothered us. The disarmament issue could be an excuse for us to expel them, but we can also keep the loyal parts. What shall we do?"
