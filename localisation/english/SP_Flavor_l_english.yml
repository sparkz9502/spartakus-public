#The Shape of Things to Come

flavor.1.t:0 "The Shape of Things to Come"
flavor.1.d:0 "The Shape of Things to Come, a science fiction alternate future novel by H. G. Wells, was released today. The book speculates on events from 1933 to 2106 from the perspective of a diplomat, Dr Philip Raven, who is said to have experienced visions of a history book published in 2106.\n\nIn the book, Wells describes a world where the escalated western economic crisis results in civil wars and unrest across Europe preceding a 2nd Great War over the Rhineland region. As with the Great War, this fictional war bogs down until the 1950's, when constant bombardments from 'air torpedoes' lay waste to the warring powers before a plague wipes out much of the population.\n\nFrom the ashes of this world, the 'Dictatorship of the Air' rises, abolishing class and religion through mass purges. This dictatorship is eventually overthrown in a bloodless coup, and the Wells ends the book with noting society has turned utopian, made up only of extremely intelligent individuals.\n\nThe book has received both praise and criticism from all spectrums. Critics have claimed the book is tainted with political bias based on Wells' socialist views, and others have described the book as 'plain out childish fantasy'. Others have praised it for being a solid work of fiction.\n\nOne can only wonder how much of Wells' predictions will come true."

#A Legionary Dream

flavor.2.title:0 "A Legionary Dream"
flavor.2.desc:0 "Today marks the day that the novel “A Legionary Dream” was published; the author’s name is unknown, only going by “the Chancellor”. The book portrays Europe in the year 2126 after a devastating conflict in the 21st century returned the continent back to the stone age. In the year 2126, 106 years after the world changing war, civilization has gradually built back up to its pre-war status, with new countries, leaders and groups emerging all over the continent. The eponymous nation, the Legion, is one of the major powers in this new Europe, and is readying itself for the coming war.\n\nThe book ends with a war between an 'unknown state' and the Legion.\n\nThe book seems to be open ended, with many expecting a sequel, while “the Chancellor” has yet to reveal themself to the public..."

#Balkan Cup

#Yugoslavia team (Balkan Cup)
sportsflavor.7.t:0 "The Creation of a Yugoslavian football team"
sportsflavor.7.d:0 "With the upcoming Balkan cup in mind, many Yugoslavists support the idea of a united Yugoslav team.
