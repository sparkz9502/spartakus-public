portuguesecivilwar_major_event_text:0 "Following a violent skirmish at the contested city of Coimbra, the conflict in Portugal has escalated to an all out war between the competing Republican and Monarchist factions.\n\nPortugal has been in a state of low-level conflict since the failure of a Monarchist coup on November 17th, 1931 in the capital of Lisbon. Resistance from the local garrison and the left-wing population escalated to revolution, and the Monarchist faction subsequently retreated to the conservative north.\n\nFor now, the outcome is uncertain, but the great powers are surely watching."

italiancivilwar_major_event_text:0 "It has been five years since the rise of the Governo Militare, the brutal ruling military dictatorship in Italy. Led by strongman General Pietro Badoglio, dissidents were arrested left and right and all real opposition was banned. A socialist revolution was averted... or so was thought.\n\nThe last year has seen a fascist coup, a worsening economic crisis, a rise in separatism, mass strikes and a massacre in Milan. This, combined with years of built up anger and division, was enough to throw the country into a state of civil war. As the populace rushes to take a side, the coming months will give an idea of what may lie ahead for Italy and perhaps Europe as a whole."

thegreatdepression_major_event_text:0 "The headline of the day will take time to process for the capitalist west. The New York Stock Exchange took an unprecedented nosedive. The United States of America, at the height of its economic prosperity, has now been launched into a crisis. While it will take time to evaluate the full impact, if one uses the 1929 London Market Crash as an example, the future is surely bleak.\n\nThe American economy survived the post-Great War economic woes and the 1929 crash through isolationism and protectionism. However, under the Hoover Administration, America reopened itself to the global economy. This means the impact will undoubtedly reach far beyond the Americas."

britainwithdraws_major_event_text:0 "In a shocking turn of events Britain has agreed to withdraw from the Second World War, facing the defeat of its continental allies and mounting losses in the Middle East. This is undoubtedly a victory for the International Proletarian Defense Pact, which has now essentially attained supremacy over the European continent, but also reflects an inability for the socialist bloc to force a regime change in Britain in their favor.\n\nThis begins a new era for Britain, which will now have to reckon with the economic consequences of being isolated from the rest of Europe, and which will face continued efforts by the socialist bloc to inspire a revolution."

fallofbritain_major_event_text:0 "Despite setbacks in Continental Europe, the British Empire has continued the fight against the socialist bloc of the International Proletarian Defense Pact. With this refusal to surrender, the socialist powers have spent extensive resources and time on preparing an ambitious invasion. These plans are now reality. With German troops parading down the streets of London, the facade of an ''impenetrable'' Fortress Britain has been broken.\n\nThe political leadership and the royalty have largely fled the country, and INPROV has declared victory, establishing a provisional military government to precede an eventual declaration of a socialist republic."

falloffrance_major_event_text:0 "After a lengthy campaign the French nation has fallen under the control of German forces and their allies. In place of the so-called ''National and Social Republic'' is now a military government, set to prepare France for a new era under a socialist government.\n\nThis is not the end of the story, however, for the remnants of the French Army and the Regime of Marshals have fled to Algeria and the colonies, preparing to make a stand alongside their British ally. Whether or not they are merely fighting a lost cause remains to be determined, but this is undeniably a great boon for the International Proletarian Defense Pact."

fallofgermany_major_event_text:0 "The hammer and compass stands blunted today with the fall of the Free Socialist Republic of Germany, the foremost bastion of international socialism. Their loss comes at a great cost for the International Proletarian Defense Pact, which has lost its foremost industrial and military power.\n\nIt is not the end of the conflict between capitalism and socialism, however, for the Soviet Union and the other remnants of the socialist bloc continue the fight, one day hoping to liberate Germany and restore the exiled leadership. How long or successful this struggle will be remains to be seen."

fallofjapan_major_event_text:0 "Japan, the eastern bastion of anti-communism, has succumb to the spreading red tide. After a lengthy military campaign, Soviet forces and their allies have conquered the Japanese mainland and forced the government to surrender.\n\nThis has come at an immense cost, with Japanese forces fighting to the last man in defense of their Emperor. Likewise, this is also an immense victory for the International Proletarian Defense Pact, which has eliminated their foremost rival in the Pacific region. Now begins a new task of pacifying the resistance and establishing a stable socialist government."

japanwithdraws_major_event_text:0 "Today, Japanese representatives finalized an agreement with the International Proletarian Defense Pact to end hostilities. Such a step was not taken lightly among the Japanese military, with hardline elements crushed after attempting to force a continued war against Bolshevism. With the irrecoverable loss of their continental holdings, the Japanese government was forced to accept the reality of the war.\n\nThis treaty has saved Japan from socialism, at least for now, but has also left them isolated and humiliated. What this means for the future is a question speculated across the world."

ussrwithdraws_major_event_text:0 "Revolutionary socialists around the world stand shocked today upon the announcement of peace between the Soviet Union and the anti-communist Allied powers. This comes under harsh terms that have greatly reduced Soviet borders and effectively dismantled the International Proletarian Defense Pact.\n\nThe defeat of Germany left the Soviets with a burden they could not sustain, and this was predictable outcome. Only the vastness of Russia and the impossibility of completely occupying it has saved the Bolsheviks from being deposed, but it is unknown how long this will last."
