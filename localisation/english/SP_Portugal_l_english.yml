POR_civil_war:0 "Portuguese Civil War"
POR_civil_war_desc:0 "After a disastrous showing in the Great War, Portugal has spent the years since in seemingly perpetual chaos. The humilation of the Republic which had only just been established in 1910 brought about renewed sympathies for the deposed monarchy and, in a wider sense, conservative anti-liberal democratic ideals. A failed monarchist rebellion in Porto in 1919 established the reality of this threat, and the subsequent socialist revolutions in Europe strengthened emerging leftist forces, threatening conservative sectors of the military and society.\n\nIn May 1926 a military coup in Lisbon successfully overthrew the governing Democratic Party, which had established a corrupt monopoly over the political system. Though the masterminds behind the coup had intended to transition to a reformed democracy, other sectors in the military disagreed and moved to establish a dictatorship. This was short lived, as a military mutiny turned rebellion led to the fall of the military regime in February 1927. The leaders of the rebellion established a new government that initially stabilized the country, but the 1929 London Market Crash had devastating effects on the already fragile Portuguese economy.\n\nMultiple failed military rebellions occurred in 1930 and 1931, but these fizzled out due to a lack of cohesion. Fearful of rising communist support, the conservative opposition received support from Britain and France. This culminated in the 17 November 1931 coup, with monarchist-minded forces seizing control in Lisbon. Though initially successful, the coup failed to find support in most of the military garrisons in the south, and they were soon met by unexpected popular civilian resistance directed by socialist political forces. The monarchists retreated to the north where they had already established control, and the situation in Lisbon escalated into a socialist revolution. With military garrisons taking sides and rival governments formed, the situation has turned into an outright civil war.\n\nThis war can only be won by making proper preparations and decisions. We will need §Gweaponry§!, §Yfood§!, §Rmen§! and §Minternational support§!."

### Ideas ###
POR_divided_country:0 "A Divided Portugal"
POR_divided_country_desc:0 "Portugal has finally hit a breaking point, twenty-one years after the 1910 revolution that overthrew the monarchy. The liberal First Portuguese Republic promised education, economic prosperity and democracy. None of this was provided in the end. No one can quite say this was unexpected, however, as quite a lot led up to this. There was over fifty unstable governments, a military dictatorship under Sidónio Pais, countless failed coup attempts and uprisings, a world war, and plenty of economic trouble. Now, with another failed coup, the people have had enough, and have finally picked a side. Those in the south rally behind the red flag of socialism, while those in the north rally around the monarchist restoration. That is, to say, Portugal is in a state of civil war."
POR_revolution:0 "The Rose Revolution"
POR_revolution_desc:0 "When the military garrison in Lisbon refused to accept the cowardly surrender of the liberal government to reactionary forces, the people made their voices heard. Thousands of residents rose up in support of the garrison, armed themselves, seized government buildings and drove the traitors out. Eager for change, the population readily rallied behind the newly declared ''Socialist Republic of Portugal''. The subsequent celebrations became infamous for the distribution of roses to the revolutionaries by sympathetic florists. Thus, the name ''Rose Revolution'' was born. However, there is still much to do to complete this revolution, for a counterrevolutionary regime remains in the north. We will have to fight to survive."
POR_illiteracy:0 "Rampant Illiteracy"
POR_illiteracy_desc: "The University of Coimbra is one of the oldest universities in the world. Despite this, in an ironic turn contrary to most of Western Europe, Portugal never truly made significant steps towards developing a proper education system. Widespread public education simply isn't a thing. Education is mostly handled through religious means, and such services are mainly accessible only to middle and upper class Portuguese citizens. Even more restricted is higher levels of education, such as university, which are only accessible to the upper class. As a result of all of this, an estimated 70% of the population is illiterate. This predictably creates a plethora of issues that have pushed Portugal into the back corner of Europe."

### Leader Descriptions ###

### Events ###

por.1.t:0 "The Republic of Portugal"
por.1.d:0 "After a disastrous military showing in the Great War and the crushing defeats in Mozambique without any territorial gain, the Portuguese Republic was brought to the brink of collapse by 1919. The government had experienced the same humiliation and ineffectiveness that ended the Kingdom of Portugal less than a decade earlier, and it became clear that much of the country had begun to reconsider the usefulness of the Republican Revolution when monarchist militias seized the north in the first major counterrevolutionary revolt. The army reluctantly put down the rebellion, however many of its leaders were let free because of their status as war heroes and icons.\n\nHowever, with much of Europe succumbing to socialist revolutions in the 1920s, tensions between the far right and far left in Portugal skyrocketed, and the moderate and corrupt Republican government found itself becoming increasingly alienated among the populace. These tensions continued to boil as the government slowly collapsed and the economy with it following the 1929 London Market Crash. Some elements in the military attempted to execute a coup in May 1926. However their leader, Manuel Gomes da Costa, was assassinated during the coup attempt, and the subsequent reprisal saw the murder of 27 civilians. This action triggered the populace to resist, supported by the increasingly influential anarchist and communist movement. The government pursued the conspirators, whom many fled across the border to Spain or to the north where the stronger right wing base sheltered them. Despite the coup being defeated, the Republic continued its downward spiral as moderate leaders found their attempts to contain the left and right futile.\n\nOn 17 November 1931, yet another monarchist coup was launched, this time in Lisbon. The unstable liberal government was forced to cede power. However, the local garrison refused to accept the surrender of the liberal government and incited demonstrations against the monarchists. These calls were soon supported by the Portuguese Communist Party and the anarchist General Confederation of Labor. The monarchist soldiers were driven out of Lisbon and the left-wing populace seized government buildings, declaring the Socialist Republic of Portugal. This action became known as the ''Rose Revolution''.\n\nThe monarchists fled to the north, where they established a counterrevolutionary movement that received some support from the traditionally conservative local populace. As with previous attempts, the exiled King Manuel II was reluctant to condone a violent counterrevolution. However he soon came under pressure from the British government, and finally agreed to support the movement in December 1931. Both sides have spent most of the last two months consolidating themselves, and as such a full on civil war has not erupted yet. However, with the dawn of the new year, it seems conflict is inevitable."
por.1.a:0 "Avante!"

por.2.t:0 "Skirmish at Coimbra"
por.2.d:0 "After months of minor skirmishes that have only ended in stalemate, Monarchist forces have converged on the city of Coimbra near the de facto 'front line'. Although this wouldn't usually be of much concern, thousands of forces have been reported to be moving to reinforce the Monarchist rebels. It is unclear what this will mean."
por.2.a:0 "Push them back!"

por.3.t:0 "The Monarchists Push Back!"
por.3.d:0 "In the largest battle yet of this revolt, Monarchist rebel forces have assaulted Coimbra by the thousands. Although they have been repelled, reports have come in of further skirmishes along the whole line, and it seems likely that this will be the start of full out hostilities."
por.3.a:0 "Now is the time!"

por.4.t:0 "Victory!"
por.4.d:0 "The countryside is devastated, our people lie sick, dying and heartbroken, but it is finally over. The republic has been secured, and the revolution with it. While the times ahead may be even harder, we can only look forwards!"
por.4.a:0 "For the people!"

por.5.t:0 "The Collapse of the U.E.R."
por.5.d:0 "With the civil war now over, the fragile political alliance known as the ''Union of the Republican Left'' (União da Esquerda Republicana) has begun to fall apart. UER was a perhaps futile attempt at unity in the midst of a crisis. The leaders of the various factions now have shown no interest in maintaining this coalition, and the general public is now also increasingly taking sides.\n\nIt will now need to be decided who will take the leading political role within this new revolutionary Portugal. There is the communists in the PCP, who currently hold the most political power and have influence on some of the industrial proletariat as well as much of the rural populace. There is the anarcho-syndicalists in the CGT, who have the most influence among the industrial proletariat and who have a longer history than the communists. Finally, there is the reformists in PRED, who are underdogs but nonetheless have some support among moderates and petty bourgeoisie.\n\nDespite the collapse of the UER, the Revolutionary Committee remains the ruling body. Each faction has put forward their own proposal for how to handle the transition to socialism. Part of this includes establishing democratic functions for workers that would be used to determine which faction wields the most influence among the proletarian populace."
por.5.a:0 "Not unexpected, but nonetheless disappointing."

por.14.t:0 "Police Deployment to the North"
por.14.d:0 "It has been some time since the revolution, but various bombings and attacks have dealt major blows to our economy, stability and our population. Giving up power is obviously not an option, and it would be preferable to deploy police to the northern part of our country. The question is, should this be permanent or temporary?"
por.14.a:0 "They will never give up. Deploy indefinitely!"
por.14.b:0 "I am sure a show of force will get them to stop. Half a year and they leave."

por.30.t:0 "Minor Food Shortages Reported"
por.30.d:0 "The Civil War is starting to take a toll on our population. Although the situation is so far relatively minor, there is a number of reported food shortages in the countryside as a result of the economic transition and the isolation we have experienced. This issue is easy to fix, but will require expending resources otherwise used to win the war.\n\nRural civilians are warning us that ignoring this issue as a whole will only hurt us in the long run."
por.30.a:0 "We should take a look at this..."

por.31.t:0 "Escalating Food Shortages Reported"
por.31.d:0 "As a result of not implementing proper measures to halt the food shortage issue, the situation seems to be escalating and spreading to urban areas. This has generated much unrest among a populace that is getting more and more war weary by the minute.\n\nIt is imperative that we implement some measures to halt this immediately before it grows out of control."
por.31.a:0 "Hey, calm down, we'll fix this!"

por.32.t:0 "Major Food Shortages Reported"
por.32.d:0 "Despite major warnings that it was coming, throughout the week major food shortages have been reported across all the territory we control. This was an easily preventable issue but the resources were deemed too valuable to the war effort to spend on preventive measures.\n\nThis has severely undermined our already waning support base and can only be ended with a conclusion to this bloody conflict."
por.32.a:0 "This isn't good..."

por.40.t:0 "Rebuilding the Agricultural Sector"
por.40.d:0 "The Civil War has ravaged the countryside and has severely damaged the ability for our agricultural section to function. The frequent reports of starvations are solid proof of this issue. As part of our duties towards rebuilding from this Civil War, we must immediately decide which agricultural industry to prop up.\nSome are advocating for propping up the vast wheat industry based in Alentejo, while others are suggesting propping up the grape production industry to increase wine exports for greater profits. What will it be?"
por.40.a:0 "The wheat industry could use some help."
por.40.b:0 "Grape production for wine would be the most profitable."

por.41.t:0 "Addressing Wartime Rationing"
por.41.d:0 ""
por.41.a:0 "We must end this rationing for the sake of our people."
por.41.b:0 "Portugal is still in a crisis. Now is no time to be wasteful."

por.42.t:0 "Addressing the Economy"
por.42.d:0 ""
por.42.a:0 "Perhaps encouraging a larger female workforce would work."
por.42.b:0 "The demobilized Republican militias can do the job."

por.43.t:0 "Restoring Electricity"
por.43.d:0 ""
por.43.a:0 "Completing the Santa Luzia Dam would boost our power output."
por.43.b:0 "The Tejo Power Plant in Lisbon could use some modernizing."

por.44.t:0 "Tejo Power Plant Expansion Completed"
por.44.d:0 "After a year of expansion on the Tejo Power Plant in Lisbon, the plant is ready to serve our post-war electrical needs for the most part. Although it will not generate as much as the Santa Luzia Dam might have, it was cost efficient and that is all that matters."
por.44.a:0 "Good to hear."

por.45.t:0 "Santa Luzia Dam Completed"
por.45.d:0 "After five long years coupled with an additional two years of surveying before the Civil War, we have managed to finish the Santa Luzia Dam. It is roughly 76 metres tall and 115 metres wide and truly is remarkable achievement for our great people. The hydrodam will be used to produce vast amounts of electricity to help power all of Portugal."
por.45.a:0 "Hurrah!"




por.161.t:0 "Mobilizing Against Northern Reactionaries"
por.161.d:0 "It has been some time since the revolution, but various bombings and attacks have dealt major blows to our economy, stability and our population. Giving up our freedom is obviously not an option, and it would be preferable to mobilize and provide arms to friendly militias and peacekeeping organizations in the northern part of our country. The question is, how much of a priority should this be?"
por.161.a:0 "The internal enemy is the greatest priority, let us embark on a grand campaign."
por.161.b:0 "We can divert some arms to militias in the north, they can handle it."
