NZL_empire:0 "Member of the British Empire"
NZL_empire_desc:0 "§gThe Dominion of New Zealand is a part of the greater British Empire, and is responsible to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that leads it. Despite its small size, New Zealand is a full Dominion of the United Kingdom, and as such enjoys a high level of self-government not seen by many subjects of the Empire, but is still legally bound by the British Parliament. New Zealanders are nonetheless proud of their nation, and, unlike other parts of the Empire, largely loyal to Britain. However, the issue of conscription becomes ever more controversial, and with it New Zealand's subordinate position within the Empire, and it's becoming increasingly unsure whether New Zealanders will be happy to go to die in Europe once more..."  
NZL_depression:0 "The Aftermath of the London Crash"
NZL_depression_desc:0 "Like their larger sibling in the antipodes, New Zealand was hit hard by the London Crash of 1929. In fact, New Zealand’s economy is doing even worse, with wool prices at record lows and all other exports threatened. Because of this, New Zealand has fallen into poverty, a poverty even greater than most other regions of the British Empire. To recover will be a monumental task, but something must be done about this sorry situation." 
NZL_japaids:0 "Japanese Trade"
NZL_japaids_desc:0 "With Britain's economy in shambles, a new Empire has come to our aid - the Empire of Japan. Japan's economy has stayed strong despite the London Crash and, as Britain's loyal ally in the Pacific, now supports New Zealand's struggling economy with favourable trade agreements and investments."
