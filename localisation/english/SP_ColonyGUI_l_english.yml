Arab-Berbers, Berbers, French, Jews\n\n§gThe French conquest of Algeria began in 1830 with the invasion of Algiers, and now over a century later the whole territory stands under French rule. Unlike the rest of the French colonial possessions in Africa, Algeria has been treated as an integral part of France. The northern part of Algeria is organized into three departments: Oran, Alger and Constantine, which are theoretically on the same level as the departments in Metropolitan France. However, under the Code de l'Indigénat the majority Muslim native inhabitants are largely ineligible for French citizenship. Despite paying taxes, non-citizens cannot vote, which means the political representation for Algeria comes almost solely from the Pied-Noir population, composed of Christians of European descent as well as Jews. This situation is a source of discontent for native Algerians, threatening the stability of France's crown jewel of colonialism.§!"
var_colony.2:0 "§dFrench Algeria (Southern Territories)§!\n§YCapital:§! Algiers\n§YEthnic Groups:§! Arab-Berbers, Berbers, French, Jews\n\n§gThe French conquest of Algeria began in 1830 with the invasion of Algiers, and now over a century later the whole territory stands under French rule. In contrast with the populous north, which has been treated as an integral part of France organized into three departments, the sparsely populated south is organized into four territories: Aïn-Sefra, Oasis, Ghardaïa and Touggourt. These territories are under military rule, directly administered by the Governor-General of Algeria. Unlike the native Muslims in the northern departments, the inhabitants of the southern territories have no way of gaining French citizenship, and laws extending rights to Muslims generally do not apply.§!"

Haratins, Arab-Berbers, Toucouleurs, Fulanis, Wolofs, Soninkes, Bambaras\n\n§gMauritania, nicknamed ''the great void'', is the least populated and developed holding of France in West Africa. With the absence of any significant settlements, French rule is exercised from the town of Saint-Louis in neighboring Senegal. Though largely pacified, Mauritania is still subject to nomadic raids, a phenomenon exacerbated by the lack of French interest to devote resources towards defending the colony, which is perceived as economically worthless. As an extended consequence of this lack of authority, the traditional enslavement of the black Haratins by the lighter skinned Arab-Berbers continues to persist, despite an official decree abolishing it.§!"
var_colony.4:0 "§dFrench Senegal§!\n§YCapital:§! Dakar\n§YEthnic Groups:§! Wolofs, Fulanis, Toucouleurs, Serers, Mandinkas, Jolas, Soninkes, French\n\n§gSenegal shines as the great jewel of French colonialism in West Africa, and as the most economically developed and integrated colony of the federation of French West Africa, it naturally stands as its capital. French presence first began in 1659 with the establishment of Saint-Louis, a trading post at the mouth of the Senegal River. Serving as an important base for the slave trade, the French extended their rule along the coast in the following decades, and later the interior by the end of the 19th century. The cities of Dakar, Saint-Louis, Rufisque and the island of Gorée have a special status as part of the "four communes", whereby the natives are considered French citizens. As a result, Senegal stands uniquely as the only French colony with significant native political representation.§!"
