illyria.1.t:0 "Inferno Waiting To Happen"
illyria.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Italy succeeded in protecting its interests over the eastern seaboard through the short and bloody Adriatic War - an intervention in Montenegro's Christmas Uprising turned into a full-out invasion. The South Slavic regions crumbled, ravaged by the 4 years of the Great War and turned to dust once the Italians steamrolled the Karađorđević’s new territories. A period of total political and social confusion ensued.\n\nSlovenia, Croatia and Bosnia officially remained under Italian military control. Those skeptical of Yugoslavia were silent on the issue, declining to participate on either the Serbian or Italians behalf. Those more enthusiastic about the unification with Serbia reacted harshly, the most notable examples being the brothers Svetozar and Adam Pribićević. The two attempted to rally Serbs in Dalmatia to oppose the Italian forces even during the war, with little to no success. Italian forces managed to capture them in late 1919 and they were both executed. Without anyone at their head, even Croatian Serbs fell into the same disarray and apathy as the rest of the residents of the newly occupied territories.\n\nThe new management transparently advanced its own interests. Italy had left the occupied territory, now the “Kingdom of Croats, Serbs and Slovenes” with a buffoonish and greedy member of the Savoy-Aosta dynasty in charge, little to no support in economic development, and a mining company, the SAd'EMB  funneling raw materials straight into the Italian economy with little compensation for the local population. The name of the subject changing to Illyria was a poor attempt to play up national unity, just like the monarchs change of name to Tomislav II - with “Frankopan” cynically added to maximize the amount of references to Croatian national icons.\n\nAs time passes, the sense of defeat and apathy passes by too. A populist Croatian agrarian movement, the HRSS, is ascendant, and its paramilitaries growing. The AIF in Slovenia remains plotting, and the KPJ is still convening in secret across the nation. The land will soon be set ablaze..."
illyria.1.a:0 "Na oganj ulja ne lijevaj!"
illyria.2.t:0 "Italian Soldiers Return to Illyria"
illyria.2.d:0 "In response to increasing tensions in the Balkans, Italy has approved the re-manning of several military posts in Croatia and Bosnia. The allied soldiers as well as foreign expertise and a closer link to Italy will help us fight back if the Yugoslavs decide to strike."
illyria.2.a:0 "Great news!"
illyria.3.t:0 "The National Salvation Committee"
illyria.3.d:0 "The National Salvation Committee (Serbocroatian: Odbor Narodnog Spasa, ONS) was founded in Sarajevo in 1927 by a group of Muslim clerics, with the goal of arming and organizing Muslims in order to preserve their autonomy from the Italian occupiers and build their national identity. Unlike other organizations such as the Young Muslims and chetnik groups, it's inclusive of all three primary ethnic groups in Bosnia & Herzegovina, further strengthening it. Allied with the even more powerful HRSS, it represents another threat to our government.\n\nRecently, the ONS has been fairly dormant and has primarily engaged in propaganda campaigning in the urban centres and countryside, but is nonetheless threatening to our unstable administration."
illyria.3.a:0 "Who cares?"
illyria.4.t:0 "Shockwaves from Serbia"
illyria.4.d:0 "The recent democratization of Serbia has already massively upset our political climate. Stjepan Radić and his republican peasant party now have close allies with the Serbian democrats in the east, and word is spreading that they're plotting to overthrow the Illyrian king and unite into a federation with Serbia!"
illyria.4.a:0 "We have to stop them!"
illyria.5.t:0 "Radić Delivers a Speech"
illyria.5.d:0 "'Croatian citizens do not recognize the so called Kingdom of Illyria under the house of Savoy because this kingdom was proclaimed other than by the Croatian Sabor and without any mandate of the Croatian People!' \n§ Stjepan Radić strikes another blow to the kingdom with a truly moving speech against it. Many have gathered in Karlovac to hear it, obviously attracting our attention. What should we do with him?"
illyria.5.a:0 "Arrest the fool!"
illyria.5.b:0 "He got away..."
illyria.6.t:0 "Republicans At War"
illyria.6.d:0 "Fed up with years of political oppression the sudden and violent reprisal against the HRSS, Croatian republican's and the Council of National Salvation's paramilitary formations are slowly emerging. Some are treating it as an act of war, intending to overthrow our government..."
illyria.6.a:0 "Shut them down!"
illyria.7.t:0 "Militants Attack!"
illyria.7.d:0 "Alongside its own paramilitaries, a large number of police and gendarmerie switched their allegiance to the HRSS. With several cities under the control of the republican government, apprehensions of numerous individuals deemed to be political enemies and pro-Italian have begun, with the far-right HRP elements of the revolutionaries even attacking innocent Italian citizens. Meanwhile, in parts of Bosnia, members of the Council of National Salvation broke into a number of Italian weapons depots, stealing dozens of rifles and machine guns, as well as ammunition and hand grenades."
illyria.7.a:0 "We have no choice now - seek help from Italy"
illyria.7.b:0 "Lepa naša domovino..."
illyria.7.c:0 "Od Drine do Une..."
illyria.8.t:0 "The Albona Republic"
illyria.8.d:0 "Workers' organizations in Istria and Dalmatia have been a thorn in the stability of the newly acquired territories ever since the end of the Great War, and as the war with Yugoslavia begun, we've taken even more action against them in a bid to stop them from defecting to our enemies.\n\nOur police had occupied the headquarters of the Workers' Committee in Trieste, lit it on fire and attacked representatives of the Raša Mining Trade Union in just a few days.\n\nConsequently, a general strike of several thousand miners broke out in Labin, Vinež and Barban. Miners proclaimed a republic under the motto 'Kova je nasa' (The mine is ours) and begun to manage the production of mines themselves with support of the farmers. The Republic is well armed, sporting its own Red Guard led by Francesco De Gioz and strong civilian support."
illyria.8.a:0 "More of them?!"
illyria.8.b:0 "Kova je nasa!"
illyria.9.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader] Miners Uprising in Albona"
illyria.9.d:0 "Workers' organizations in Istria and Dalmatia have been a thorn in the stability of the Italians newly acquired territories ever since the end of the Great War, and as their war with Yugoslavia begun, they've taken even more action against them in a bid to stop the workers from defecting to the communists. In response to attacks at worker's organizations in Istria from the Italian police, a general strike of several thousand miners broke out in Labin, Vinež and Barban. Miners proclaimed a republic under the motto 'Kova je nasa' (The mine is ours) and begun to manage the production of mines themselves with support of the farmers. The Republic is well armed, sporting its own Red Guard led by Francesco De Gioz and strong civilian support."
illyria.9.a:0 "A surprising development"
illyria.10.t:0 "Troubles in Slovenia"
illyria.10.d:0 "Slovenia is a trisected nation - torn between the Italians, Hungarians, and German-Austria. Worst of all, forced Italianization has only been increasing the populations' dissatisfaction with foreign rule, and many see the rise of Yugoslavia in the east as an opportunity to save the struggling Slovenian identity. This has been a solid enough grounds for unification that our intelligence is reporting of a 'Anti-Imperialist Front' organizing an armed struggle in Ljubljana."
illyria.10.a:0 "Be on the lookout"
illyria.11.t:0 "AIF Rises up!"
illyria.11.d:0 "Two newly formed battalions of the Slovene anti-imperialist front have attacked our poorly defended positions in Ljubljana. They're rapidly advancing as most of our army is distracted on the eastern front."
illyria.11.a:0 "Alarming!"
illyria.12.t:0 "Disaster in Tuzla!"
illyria.12.d:0 "A catastrophe of never before seen proportions has just struck Tuzla.\n\nOver the recent months, entire neighborhoods have been slowly sinking into the ground due to the unstability of the soil exacerbated by salt extraction. Slowly, small lakes and ponds grew, as every rainfall brought more water into the depressions formed in the streets.\n\nThis was finally brought to attention of the wider public when several buildings in the old town collapsed, causing mass devastation and loss of life.\n\nCriticism from the native population and the management of the SAd'EMB is relentless. What are we to do?"
illyria.12.a:0 "We better stop the news from spreading too far!"
illyria.12.b:0 "Apologize and promise new regulations"
illyria.12.c:0 "Apologize, promise new regulations, and compensate the victims"
illyria.13.t:0 "Workers Dissatisfied"
illyria.13.d:0 "We've tried our best to minimize the effects of the Tuzla disaster, but recovery is slowing down as the workers of the SAd'EMB are becoming more and more demotivated realizing just how disregarding the Italian company's practices towards them are becoming. Unionism is on the rise, particularly in major mines near Tuzla. The General Workers Council of BiH has been massively recruiting in Kakanj and Zenica. While controls are strictening and we're certain there will be no major violence soon, this is going to have severe effects on our control over Bosnia as a whole."
illyria.13.a:0 "Commies!"
illyria.14.t:0 "The Great Depression"
illyria.14.d:0 "The Great Depression has hit Italy, ravaging its industry. This has caused a great drop in demand for raw materials from us, something our already trinket economy was reliant on. Massive lay-offs are in order as Illyria is scraping the bottom of the barrel dangerously close."
illyria.14.a:0 "Who are we going to sell all this coal to now?!"
illyria.15.t:0 "Workers Demand More Rights"
illyria.15.d:0 "Unruliness among the workers, in particular miners in central Bosnia, has been reaching dangerous levels. Our military is weak and can hardly suppress them as new strikes pop up across the country by the day. It's still not too late to give a moderating response."
illyria.15.a:0 "Accept their demands"
illyria.15.b:0 "Not happening"
illyria.16.t:0 "Strikes Spreading"
illyria.16.d:0 "The strikes are still going, with no end in sight as the economic situation keeps getting even direr. Even more moderate factions in Bosnian politics, such as the liberal resistance, are starting to vocally support the General Worker's Council, the union leading this growing movement."
illyria.16.a:0 "Just give them what they want"
illyria.16.b:0 "This is going too far! Send in the army!"
illyria.17.t:0 "An Independent Workers Congress"
illyria.17.d:0 "A significant congregation of leading Bosnian communist intellectuals and union representatives has assembled today in Zenica, escorted by a lightly armed 'Red Guard'.\n\nThere was very little we could do to stop them, as neighbouring cities and villages, both of Serb and Bosnian Muslim populations had turned openly hostile to our troops, and more similar guards cropped up, a whole guerilla army in hiding managing to wrestle control over the core of the local industry. In support of the revolt, numerous other mines and factories elsewhere in Illyria have staged strikes, with less success, but crippling our industry even further nonetheless."
illyria.17.a:0 "Damn them to hell!"
illyria.17.b:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"
illyria.18.t:0 "Ban on Native Language Not Effective"
illyria.18.d:0 "While all local governments and institutions have been ordered directly from Zagreb to prohibit official usage of Serbocroatian, its been ignored for the most part, mainly due to difficulty in actually enforcing it when the absolute majority does not speak any other language, as well as poor ability to stop institutions using it by force. The ban has only had some, if still negligible effect on the littoral regions."
illyria.18.a:0 "Disappointing..."
illyria.19.t:0 "Ban on Native Language Somewhat Effective"
illyria.19.d:0 "The order issued from Zagreb several weeks ago has been put into action in several major cities, semi-succesfully supplanting the usage of Serbocroatian in administrative institutions. Despite this, it'll be impossible to apply this to the entirety of Illyria, as much of it is monolingual and far from the sight of our security forces. We may at least attempt to advance Italians up into the bureaucracy of areas such as these, but this will take much longer."
illyria.19.a:0 "Better than nothing!"
illyria.20.t:0 "Terror in Bosnia!"
illyria.20.d:0 "As soon as the disaster in Tuzla became publicized, we attempted to create an information quarantine by fabricating false death tolls and reasoning for the catastrophe beyond the Italian mining company at fault, but as it turns out, placing the blame on Serb or Croat terrorists did not work out. The event as well as its perpetrator is now widely known throughout Illyria and even abroad, which has quickly led to protests by the opposition and strengthening of the disgruntled nationalist movements.\n\nThings only turned more sour today as a predominately Italian battalion of our security forces opened fire on a small group of protesters in Sarajevo. Thankfully, the 'skirmish' was short and with a low death toll (and an even lower official one), but has nevertheless created an atmosphere of fear among the opposition."
illyria.20.a:0 "Fire the soldiers and repay the victims before it turns worse!"
illyria.20.b:0 "Disband Slavic divisions and let the security forces loose on the rioters."
illyria.30.t:0 "Public Outcry against Mismanagement"
illyria.30.d:0 ""
illyria.30.a:0 ""
illyria.40.t:0 "The HRSS"
illyria.40.d:0 "The Croatian Republican Peasant Party - HRSS - and its leader Stjepan Radić is Illyria's most dangerous enemy. A unusual movement which could only be described as agrarian populist, with some elements of utopian socialism, anti-clericalism and liberal republicanism all unified into a big tent by nationalism. It boasts the bulk of popular support among the Croatian people, two paramilitaries, the Peasant Defence Force and the Civilian Defence Force, and close ties to both the west and the bolsheviks.\n\nThe position of the HRSS remains largely unresolved as we've not been able to do anything but declare it illegal - even arresting Radić again could easily lead down to calamity."
illyria.40.a:0 "Bah! A bunch of chicken farmers."

#Illyria- Italian Civil War
illita.1.t:0 "Italy in Disarray"
illita.1.d:0 "Italy has descended into civil war, with the north of the country occupied by communist radicals, largely cutting us off from Rome. As Illyria is still dependent on the few Italian units and their terror campaign to keep the country in one piece, the situation is turning quite perilous. Major changes will need to be made to the way this country is administered."
illita.1.a:0 "Convene a special session of the Croatian Sabor with native parties"
illita.1.b:0 "Declare a state of emergency and offer to protect Dalmatia"
illita.2.t:0 "The Sabor Votes"
illita.2.d:0 "The Croatian Sabor or Parliament has convened for the first time since it decided on the formation of the Kingdom of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in 1918. The Italian occupators prohibited its operation up until now. Illyria is faced with the challenge of surviving the chaos in Italy and the looming threat of a fascist or communist insurgency. The king has essentially zero support in the country, and is faced with an emerging power struggle in the parliament."
illita.2.a:0 "Native parties vote for independence from Italy, the HRSS heads the Sabor"
illita.2.b:0 "'Arrange' the Sabor to support the monarch"
illita.2.c:0 "The session is inconclusive"


illita.10.t:0 "Slovene Representatives Boycott the Sabor"
illita.10.d:0 "Representatives of Slovene parties, already disgruntled at years of nearly no representation in Illyrian politics, are withdrawing and protesting the parliament's apparently corrupt decisions."
illita.10.a:0 "They can protest all they want!"
illita.11.t:0 "HRSS Reacts to Corruption"
illita.11.d:0 "Croatian Republicans have joined their Slovene brethren in protesting the Sabor's corruption. While they're not as up in arms about it, this will surely destabilize our political institutions..."
illita.11.a:0 "Damn them to hell!"
illita.12.t:0 "Slovene Separatists Forming Own Political Institutions"
illita.12.d:0 "While mainstream Slovene politicians had remained in peaceful resistance, the more radical socialists are organizing in plain sight. The Slovene Anti-Imperialist Front now has branches all over Slovenia, and is smuggling goods and arms from Hungary."
illita.12.a:0 "Fuck!"
illita.13.t:0 "Slovenia Declares Independence"
illita.13.d:0 "The situation in Slovenia has reached a tipping point with a coalition of Slovene parties approving a movement to declare independence. Units of the AIF are swarming the nation and our troops in Slovenia are being driven out one by one."
illita.13.a:0 "Stop right there!"
illita.13.b:0 "Death to Italy!"

illita.20.t:0 "Representatives Angry"

illita.21.d:0 ""
illita.21.a:0 ""

illita.50.t:0 "The Monarchy in Exile"
illita.50.d:0 "Rome has fallen! Fascist blackshirts march through the streets all over Italy and the royal family has come to us seeking refuge. This will immediately place us at odds with the new leadership in Italy, but we have no choice. Besides, confronting the fascists openly will help stabilize us, as most of the native population is aware that falling under Mussolinis rule would be far, far worse for them and as such are willing to support our war effort."
illita.50.a:0 "This marks the beggining of a new age"
illita.51.t:0 "A Grand Alliance"
illita.51.d:0 "The only way we're going to keep this provisional government stable is to fulfill the republicans demands, and enter a moderate popular front with them. The HRSS, HSP, and possibly even SZJ might be willing to enter a temporary pact."
illita.51.a:0 "Alright"

illyriaplot.1.t:0 "Intrigue in the Administration"
illyriaplot.1.d:0 "The Illyrian administration was built on the shaky basis of an alliance with some of the more collaborative Croat political leaders. As the civil war in Italy rages on and there is little to back the king, Tomislav is turning more wary of them..."
illyriaplot.1.a:0 "Who knows what they could be up to!"
illyriaplot.2.t:0 "Ties between the Republicans and Corporatists?"
illyriaplot.2.d:0 "It appears that our suspicions have been confirmed. Some of our higher ranking representatives from across the political spectrum have been working together on a united agenda, possibly against the monarch."
illyriaplot.2.a:0 "Uh oh"
illyriaplot.3.t:0 "Arrest the Suspects?"
illyriaplot.3.d:0 "Security forces have rounded up some of the officials charged for potentially treasonous activity. This includes the governor of Bosnia, Nikola Mandić, HRSS activist August Košutić, and worst of all, our minister of foreign affairs, Mladen Lorković. What should we do with them?"
illyriaplot.3.a:0 "The charges are unsubstantiated, release them"
illyriaplot.3.b:0 "May they rot in their cells!"
illyriaplot.4.t:0 "The HRP Comes Forth"
illyriaplot.4.d:0 "Finally backed by the HSP and the right wing of the HRSS, Lorković and his affiliates have begun the execution of their plot. The governing bodies of Bosnia and most of Croatia are joining them in ceasing public functions until the king abdicates, and each of the parties militia wings is threatening direct action if we do not concede to them."
illyriaplot.4.a:0 "There's nothing we can do about it now"
illyriaplot.4.b:0 "Evacuate the king and start fighting back the Croats!"
illyriaplot.4.c:0 "The time has come for Croatia to rise up..."

#Tito
illyriatito.1.t:0 "The Status of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia"
illyriatito.1.d:0 "When Yugoslavia was shattered, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia - KPJ - was one of the last political organizations to retain its integrity and keep operating from Triglav to Vardar. However, the hostile conditions of the newly-formed states did lend to more isolated leaderships, and so, in Illyria, a man known by many names, from John Alexander Karlsson to Spiridon Mekas, had risen to prominence.\n\nJosip Broz 'Tito', a brilliant and charismatic ex-soldier who had succesfuly led and escaped multiple failed uprisings and had drawn a loyal following of workers eager to join him in arms again and again. He and his gang of marauders are currently in hiding, only surfacing in the shadows through quasi-legal and short-lived progressive publications and organization or instances where they attempt to spread propaganda among our people."
illyriatito.1.a:0 "He can hide and run, but he can't escape us!"
