chacowar.1.t:0 "The Chaco Dispute"
chacowar.1.d:0 "Bolivia and Paraguay have been locked in a conflict for decades over the disputed Gran Chaco region. There have been multiple attempts to establish a defined border in the past, but these have all failed in spite of foreign arbitration. As a result, the border can only be determined by loose ''de facto'' borders displayed by the dozens of military outposts dotted throughout the region.\n\nThe dispute was once of a relatively mild nature, with occasional conflicts between military explorers. In recent years the conflict has greatly intensified, in significant part because of speculated but unproven oil deposits. In 1927 a Paraguayan patrol was captured by Bolivian forces and its commander was killed. A brief war erupted in 1928, with both sides seizing land, but a return to the status quo was achieved under international pressure. Neither side was ready for a protracted war at that point, and in the aftermath an arms race would begin.\n\nIt is now 1932 and both sides have accumulated significant amounts of weaponry. War is on the horizon and everyone knows it. It is simply a matter of when, not if, the conflict erupts again."
