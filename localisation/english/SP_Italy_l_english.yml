ita.1.t:0 "Introduction to Italy - The Conflicts"
ita.1.d:0 "Italy is in a period of chaos. Such a fact simply cannot be denied. It has been only 60 years since the Risorgimento unified the people of Italy. Yet, nowadays Italians are more divided than ever before. Not only are they divided by ideology, but also by identity. Separatism is on the rise in many places in the country, with nationalist militias waging a guerilla war against our government. Of course, this all comes with a crucial background.\n\nAlthough Italy was a victorious participant in the Great War, said victory came at a great cost. Over 1,000,000 Italian soldiers fell as casualties in the war, and Italy emerged in an economic disaster. Soldiers and workers flocked to socialist parties and unions, and the stability of liberal democracy was soon challenged.\n\nTo make matters worse, the territorial gains promised to Italy in the Balkans had to be fought for, for Serbia launched an attempt to form a ‘’Yugoslav’’ federation encompassing lands far beyond what was promised to them in the Treaty of London. Such a situation culminated in the Adriatic War in 1919, which was met at home in Italy with mixed reactions. Nationalists applauded the efforts, while socialists and even some moderates saw it as needless bloodshed for an already war torn Italy.\n\nUltimately, Italy emerged victorious in the war, which lasted only a little over two months. Italy gained Spalato, Zara, the Dalmatian islands and the disputed territory of Fiume. Additionally, an Italian puppet state was set up encompassing Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, which became known as Illyria. Italy also aided the Montenegrin nationalist ‘’Greens’’ in defeating the pro-Serb ‘’Whites’’, and the exiled monarch Danilo I was placed back in power, but not without Montenegro losing some of its economic freedoms.\n\nThe next conflict came in Albania, but here Italy was unable to direct the resources necessary for the most extreme nationalist ambitions to be met. Due to the demobilization of the Italian Army, Italy had been forced to abandon its occupation of much of Albania. Albanian nationalist rebels besieged the port of Vlore, which the Italians refused to hand over to the Albanian government. Malaria spread, soldiers refused to fight and talk of a communist uprising spread. Troops set for Vlore striked in Ancona and waved the red socialist flag, and support for their cause spread across much of Central Italy. On the brink of defeat, Italy was barely saved from total humiliation by the coronation of Audrey Herbert as King of Albania. Peace was brokered and the underdeveloped Albanian economy was subjected to domination by Italian corporations. However, the reception at home was universally poor, with nationalists labelling it as a humiliating defeat, socialists labelling it as a war on behalf of corporate capitalist interests, and others considering it a costly and unproductive conflict."
ita.1.a:0 "Very interesting, but what kind of division are we talking about?"
ita.1.b:0 "I don't need to know about this."

ita.2.t:0 "Introduction to Italy - The Early Years"
ita.2.d:0 "Ten years ago, the National Fascist Party (PNF) and their paramilitary Blackshirts marched on the capital of Rome and attempted to seize power in a coup d’etat. Under immense pressure from the military, the King authorized the suppression of the Blackshirts, and Italy was changed forever. This was a result of years of revolutionary unrest that would only grow after this event. The fascists were led by Benito Mussolini, a former radical socialist turned rabid anti-socialist nationalist. This event became known as the March on Rome.\n\nThis event was a direct result of the events that preceded it. Throughout the previous four years, Italy seemed on the brink of a socialist revolution. Socialist-led strikes were common, as were their suppression by both fascist/nationalist paramilitaries and the military. Factories in the industrialized north were occupied by their workers and self managed for periods of time. The Ancona Revolt showed that not even the military could be relied on to stand by the government. Amidst this chaos, the Italian Fasci of Combat was formed, as was their paramilitary known as the Camicie Nere, or the Blackshirts. Socialists formed their own ‘’Proletarian Defense Formations’’, such as the Guardie Rosse (Red Guards) and the infamous Arditi del Popolo, which was composed largely by socialist Great War veterans.\n\nThe fascists forged an alliance with a number of liberals and conservatives, as well as other nationalists. They formed the National Blocs electoral alliance for the 1921 elections. They were crucially supported by the liberal Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti. This alliance turned the fascists from a relatively irrelevant group of nationalists to a formidable political force. At the same time, the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) found itself divided on whether or not to support the ongoing revolutionary activity, as well as whether or not to align with the Comintern. Ultimately, the party chose to expel its reformists, who formed the Unitary Socialist Party (PSU). The PSI was renamed to the Communist Party of Italy (PCd’I), and quickly gathered up support from supporters of the PSI.\n\nThe 1921 election was contentious, but the PCd’I emerged as the largest party, though it failed to secure as many votes as the PSI. As with previous elections for the PSI, this was not enough to allow the PCd’I to form a government, and as a result the other parties formed a coalition. Fascists entered government for the first time, and soon began seeking support from the big businesses. Convinced of the danger of a socialist revolution, they received much support from these interests. This emboldenment directly resulted in the March on Rome, which even had support from American diplomats. The subsequent suppression of the coup only served to create more uncertainty, and the PNF was banned and forced underground. Mussolini and many other fascist figures were arrested and imprisoned, where the majority still remain."
ita.2.a:0 "And what kind of mess followed this?"
ita.2.b:0 "I've heard enough."

ita.3.t:0 "Introduction to Italy - The Years of Lead"
ita.3.d:0 "The suppression of the PNF did very little to end the overall instability that plagued Italy at the time. Although the 1921-1924 period had less strikes and instances of violence than the 1919-1920 period, the situation could hardly be considered stable. The National Blocs were dissolved and the involved parties quickly distanced themselves from the fascists, reaffirming their commitment to the monarchy. Fast approaching were the 1924 elections. Negotiations for a joint electoral list of liberal and conservative parties failed, and the parties prepared to run on their own against the increasingly popular communists. The successful revolution in Germany inspired many workers and peasants, and many aligned themselves with the PCd’I.\n\nThe 1924 election, like the previous election, was contentious. The Italian Liberal Party rallied and tried to position itself as the primary political opposition to the communists. They succeeded in gathering many former National Blocs voters, and emerged with about 20% of the vote. However, this was far from what they had achieved before the Great War, and the PCd’I ultimately made gains that surpassed its predecessor, the PSI. Once again the liberal democratic parties formed a coalition to oppose them.\n\nAlso notable in the elections was the unexpected rise of regionalism and separatism. In Venice, the left-wing regionalist party Lion of Saint Mark emerged with the largest vote share. Although then closely aligned with the Italian People’s Party (PPI), the party, led by trade unionist Italico Corradino Cappellotto, would later go on to pursue a path of opposition. In Sardinia, the separatist Sardinian Action Party secured a majority of the vote, doubling their previous results in the 1921 election. The results shocked an already polarized nation.\n\nThe time following the 1924 election saw the resumption of consistent political violence and labour unrest. Although the PNF was banned, their members continued to operate underground, and orchestrated a number of attacks against politicians and notable figures. Some of these attacks were even staged in a way that would lead investigators to communists, rather than fascists. Communist militant groups also orchestrated their own attacks and clashed with the military and police during strikes. During these events, hundreds were killed and many more arrested. However, the most infamous of these political killings would come in 1928 with the assassination of Prime Minister Luigi Sturzo, and the importance of this assassination and the events that would follow it would directly result in this period becoming so memorable."
ita.3.a:0 "Well I am sure it can't get any worse from here."
ita.3.b:0 "Now I've heard enough."

ita.4.t:0 "Introduction to Italy - The Governo Militare"
ita.4.d:0 "The assassination of Prime Minister Luigi Sturzo was a turning point for Italy, as the event just fostered more political chaos that would inevitably lead to the current situation. Amidst a highly revolutionary state of affairs, the military rule of Luigi Pelloux after the Bava Beccaris massacre was brought into memory. A clique of military leaders led by Pietro Badoglio proposed the formation of a military cabinet. Though met with reluctance by the King, the proposal received the support of parliament. On 5 May 1928, Badoglio was appointed as Prime Minister.\n\nBadoglio immediately suspended the upcoming elections indefinitely and implemented laws aimed to suppress labour unrest. The communists and some dissident liberal democrats soon accused Badoglio of trying to establish a dictatorship similar to that of France. He submitted his resignation on 5 October to prove his ''dedication to democracy''. This was not the end, however, for the new liberal democratic government of Giuseppe Spataro collapsed only a few months later under the pressure of the strikes. With no clear successor, the King personally approached Badoglio to offer him the position of Prime Minister on 15 January 1929. The details of their meeting are still unclear, but what followed was the declaration of martial law followed by the vicious repression of the strikers. On 1 February, the PCd'I was banned along with four other left-wing parties.\n\nIn September that same year, the London Market Crash occurred, and the Italian economy was hit hard. Badoglio soon set about building the ''Stability Coalition'', encompassing the four major liberal democratic parties and the Italian Nationalist Association. Though secured politically, Badoglio and his government were never able to truly rebuild the economy, with the laissez-faire direction of the recovery efforts leaving the Italian economy vulnerable to another crisis.\n\nThe rise of the Governo Militare marked the end of the so-called ''Decennio Rosso'', or Red Decade. However, a new conflict arose with the rise of militant separatism after the suppression of regionalist parties under Badoglio. The already existing movements in Venice and Sardinia were radicalized into insurgency, while a new movement arose in Sicily inspired by the rise in separatism. The conflict continues to destabilize an already unstable Italy.\n\nItaly faces many hardships ahead. Its political future is uncertain, and the possibility of a disaster seems on the horizon. Some even talk of Civil War..."
ita.4.a:0 "I'm sure everything will be fine..."

itafoc.1.t:0 "The King and the Prime Minister"
itafoc.1.d:0 "With the new year arriving, yet another private meeting has been convened between Prime Minister Pietro Badoglio and King Vittorio Emanuele III. In early years, Badoglio used such meetings to gauge the King's confidence in his administration, and adjust his strategy to whatever would keep himself in power. In such turbulent times, it was not expected that Badoglio would last long.\n\nIt has now been three years since the Governo Militare was established, and its security seems all but assured. Such meetings are now used to inform the King on important matters, and to ensure the interests of the royal family are defended. Not all is good for Badoglio, for he has gone to great strides to protect the corruption of his cronies in the administration. The future is unpredictable, and a sudden crisis could unravel the entire structure. Hope remains the best defense offered by the Governo Militare against such a possibility."
itafoc.1.a:0 "Badoglio will set things straight."

itafoc.2.t:0 "Badoglio's Address"
itafoc.2.d:0 "Pietro Badoglio yet again stands in front of the Chamber of Deputies, delivering a relatively short and uninspiring speech to a parliament long sidelined in favor of military structures. Nonetheless, today is notable for a few reasons. Most notably, the so-called ''anti-socialist laws'' enacted in 1929 are set to expire soon and will need to be renewed through a parliamentary vote. Also on the agenda is Badoglio's plan to abolish the administrative districts, which have long been an annoyance to the Governo Militare.\n\nNeither of these proposals are at any risk of failing, which begs the question of why the regime has bothered to leave parliament intact at all. Badoglio personally insists on upholding a veil of democracy, in spite of reservations by some of his military allies. This status places the Governo Militare in an odd position, as a structure within a structure, with no instruments of popular support. Nonetheless, this reliance on supposed legality has worked for now."
itafoc.2.a:0 "Italy will stand united against Bolshevo-Spartacism!"

itafoc.3.t:0 "Renewal of the Anti-Socialist Laws"
itafoc.3.d:0 "The time has finally come to renew a set of laws collectively known as the ''Anti-Socialist Laws'', set to expire after a three year period. This time the laws will, if approved, be set to last for ten years. Of course, there is little doubt that parliament will pass the resolution.\n\nThe laws were established in the months after Badoglio was appointed for the second time, on 15 January 1929. Some of the laws were established via royal decree, leaving parliament no say on the matter. These include the law establishing a state of martial law and authorizing lethal force against demonstrators, and the law banning the Communist Party, Unitary Socialist Party, Republican Party and others. These were later codified in laws approved by parliament. Aside from those established by royal decree, there is also the law banning the activities of socialist trade unions, and the law authorizing the indefinite imprisonment of those suspected of treasonous activities.\n\nPrior to the vote, the Reformist Socialist Party, a supporting party of the government, announced that it would be renaming itself to the ''Labour Democratic Party'' to distance itself from ''illegal activities that stand opposed to the sovereignty of the Italian nation''."
itafoc.3.a:0 "The motion passes unanimously!"

itafoc.4.t:0 "The Question of the Fascists"
itafoc.4.d:0 "1932 will mark the ten year anniversary of the failed fascist coup known as the March on Rome. In its wake, thousands of fascists were arrested and many were sentenced to lengthy stays in prison. At the top is Benito Mussolini, sentenced to thirty years for treason. Many of those sentenced have since been released, but hundreds still remain in prison. Some monarchist-oriented fascists, like Emilio De Bono, were spared prison but forced into retirement.\n\nWith ten years having passed, some within the regime, particularly those aligned with the Italian Nationalist Association, have suggested issuing an amnesty for some of the lower level fascists who are still in prison, with Mussolini naturally being excluded. Others within the regime have fiercely opposed this proposal, fearing it could give the fascists an opportunity to reorganize and challenge the Governo Militare.\n\nUltimately the choice falls to Badoglio."
itafoc.4.a:0 "A few amnesties may be in order."
itafoc.4.b:0 "They must learn their lesson the hard way."

itafoc.5.t:0 "Rising Discontent"
itafoc.5.d:0 "Our choice to slash public spending, however necessary it may have been, has caused a great amount of discontent among much of the population. Many thousands of people now face the prospect of losing their jobs, and basic services will now be less affordable. In the short term it is very possible that this will increase sympathies for opposition movements. However, the long term hope is that this choice will eventually lead to a balanced budget and a general recovery. Perhaps hope isn't the sturdiest foundation, but we don't have much of a choice."
itafoc.5.a:0 "This will work, right?"

itafoc.6.t:0 "Crisis in the Banks"
itafoc.6.d:0 "It is clear that the situation in the banks is rapidly deteriorating. These globally connected institutions are central to the stability of our economy, and their descent towards bankruptcy threatens to bring our whole nation down. Sitting idle as they collapse is simply not an option, but the solution is hardly clear cut.\n\nOn one side, some have suggested bailing out all of the banks and increasing government oversight to ensure their survival. However, this would cost an immense amount of economic resources that we arguably do not have. On the other hand the alternative is to focus on saving the institutions that can be saved and leaving the rest of the banks to fall. Though this will keep money in the treasury, it will undoubtedly lead to the failure of some factories connected to the banks. In turn this is likely to anger the workers, who will face unemployment. Neither is a perfect option, but a choice has to be made."
itafoc.6.a:0 "We cannot let them fail."
itafoc.6.b:0 "We will do what we can."

itapol.1.t:0 "Market Crash in the United States!"
itapol.1.d:0 "Shocking news has arrived from the United States! Stock shares on the New York Stock Exchange have taken a plunge in value as a result of mass sell-offs. Efforts to prevent a crash have apparently failed, with declining economic performance in the American economy crushing confidence among investors. The situation is not yet at a point of no return, but recovery is uncertain.\n\nFor Italy, the consequences could be long-reaching. The 1929 London Market Crash caused a downturn that we have only partially recovered from. The laissez-faire economic policy of Finance Minister Alberto De Stefani has rejuvenated investments and trade, but these gains were already beginning to wane since mid-1931. Another crisis could spell disaster, and there are only so many options available to address it.\n\nIn regards to the immediate situation, the primary effects will be seen on the Milan Stock Exchange, with low enthusiasm causing sell-offs and a drop in share values. If the situation does not improve, a bankruptcy crisis in the banks and industrial companies is likely."
itapol.1.a:0 "Che peccato!"

itapol.2.t:0 "Declines in International Trade"
itapol.2.d:0 "The New York market crash has gradually begun to have a global impact in the absence of a recovery. Troubles in the internationally connected banking system have been disrupted by bank runs and investigations into leading business figures. This has been combined with a general decrease in international trade.\n\nMonths later, the effects are beginning to be witnessed in Italy, with a general decrease in demand for industrial and agricultural goods. The prices of these goods are quickly plummeting, with Italian markets unable to compete amidst rising protectionism."
itapol.2.a:0 "Something must be done."

itapol.3.t:0 "A Breaking Point"
itapol.3.d:0 "The global economic crisis, despite our hopes, has only continued to get worse over the last few months. European nations, including our own, have been reluctant to take measures against this economic depression, having expected markets to rebound. Now things are too late, as the Austrian Creditanstalt bank, a centerpiece of European banking, has declared bankruptcy.\n\nThe Italian economy will not be able to weather this storm without some sort of action, whatever it may be. One one side are the economic liberals, who propose focusing on slashing public spending and stabilizing the currency. On the other hand, the economic nationalists believe we should invest in public works and pursue autarky."
itapol.3.a:0 "Now is the time for action!"

itapol.10.t:0 "May Day FIAT Strike"
itapol.10.d:0 "In the industrial northern city of Torino, workers at the Lingotto FIAT factory have went on strike in protest against their working conditions. Outright acts of rebellion like this have been rare since such actions were outlawed under the Badoglio government, but it seems the effects of the ongoing economic crisis have driven the situation to a breaking point. Tens of thousands of workers are estimated to be involved in the strike action, and production has practically come to a halt.\n\nThere is little doubt that the clandestine communist movement has played a part in organizing the strike. However, it is equally as clear that violently suppressing the strike is not an optimal course of action. The demands of the strikers are not outright revolutionary, likely intentionally given the penal code authorizes the death penalty for association with militant socialism. Rather, they demand increases in wages, which were slashed after the onset of the economic crisis, as well as a decrease in working hours, which are currently as high as 12 hours per day.\n\nRegardless of how the strike is resolved, the effects of a long term strike could prove to be crippling, given FIAT supplies well over 80% of Italian automobile production. If not contained, the strike could very well spread to other industries across the country, which could prove to be even more disastrous."
itapol.10.a:0 "They are bold, that cannot be denied."

itapostcw.1.t:0 "The End of the Civil War"
itapostcw.1.d:0 "Now that the civil war has come to an end, the Kingdom of Italy enters a new era. The Governo Militare, whom many have blamed for the civil war, is long dismantled. In its place is a provisional government led by the Liberal Party. However, the population has not yet forgotten the crucial support provided by the same parties for the Governo Militare at its height. It seems the country is heading for a total political restructuring.\n\nThere are many questions ahead. How did the nation get to this situation in the first place? How is such destruction to be prevented in the future? Perhaps even more important for the common folk is what fate will meet those formerly in charge of the military dictatorship.\n\nRegardless of how these questions are answered, new elections are being organized for the first time in many years. In the absence of the communists and fascists, a victory for the liberal democratic parties is all but assured. However, the question is still left open as to which parties will form a government."
itapostcw.1.a:0 "How will democracy fare this time?"

itapostcw.10.t:0 "Victory of the Popular Catholic Action"
itapostcw.10.d:0 "The Popular Catholic Action, an electoral alliance between the newly formed Democrazia Cristiana and various smaller parties and organizations, has emerged victorious in the first elections since 1924 with a remarkable result. Its origins can be traced to the reconciliatory meeting of Catholic political figures in the Camaldoli monastery during the civil war. The Italian People's Party had greatly fractured over support for the Governo Militare, with many figures of the internal centre-left going into opposition.\n\nThe nature of the parliamentary political system, however, leaves the alliance with the need for parliamentary support from another major party. The question has reopened the old internal factional wounds. The left-wing of the alliance, led by Francesco Luigi Ferrari and Giovanni Gronchi, supports a coalition with the Labour Democratic Party, while the right-wing, led by Alcide De Gasperi, supports a coalition with the Liberal Party.\n\nAlthough the coalition question is a great source of divide, the factions have deeper conflicts that come down to policy and identity. The left-wing claims the ''Popularist'' legacy of Luigi Sturzo, whose assassination famously led to the Governo Militare. In line with said legacy they are supportive of expanded suffrage, land reform, constitutional restrictions on the monarchy and secularisation. On the other hand, the right-wing of De Gasperi has made it clear they wish to forge a unified party that can appeal to all Catholics on a moderated basis."
itapostcw.10.a:0 "Who will emerge victorious, I wonder?"

itapostcw.20.t:0 "Formation of the Ferrari Cabinet"
itapostcw.20.d:0 "With the victory of the centre-left faction of Democrazia Cristiana over De Gasperi's right-wing, a coalition government has been successfully formed between Democrazia Cristiana and the Labour Democrats. The cabinet, as per private terms discussed by the two parties, is mostly composed of members of Democrazia Cristiana, with the Labour Democrats holding the Finance, Education and Defence Ministries. Francesco Luigi Ferrari, the leader of the internal centre-left, will be sworn in as Prime Minister, with his close ally and friend Giovanni Gronchi as his secretary."
itapostcw.20.a:0 "The Popularist legacy will endure!"

itapostcw.21.t:0 "Formation of the De Gasperi Cabinet"
itapostcw.21.d:0 "With the victory of the right-wing faction of Democrazia Cristiana over Ferrari's centre-left, a coalition government has been successfully formed between Democrazia Cristiana and the Liberal Party. It was not an easy government to form, given the two parties have historically clashed on various issues. Nonetheless, an agreement was made, with members of Democrazia Cristiana controlling most ministries and the Liberals controlling the prestigious Foreign Ministry as well as the Education Ministry. Alcide De Gasperi, the leader of the internal right-wing, will be sworn in as Prime Minister, with party ally Paolo Cappa as his secretary."
itapostcw.21.a:0 "Italy shall be a country of Christian values."

itaflv.1.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Death of Filippo Turati"
itaflv.1.d:0 "On March 29th, longtime Italian socialist Filippo Turati died in exile in London at the age of 74.\n\nTurati, a leading figure of the now-defunct Italian Socialist Party, was head of the moderate reformist wing. Turati and his faction were expelled from the party in 1921 after its members voted to adhere to the Communist International. He and his supporters formed the Unitary Socialist Party, now known as the Italian Worker's Socialist Party. In wake of the rise of the Governo Militare and the banning of the socialist parties, Turati fled Italy alongside others, taking refuge in the United Kingdom. His influence in exile was minimal, with other figures like Giacomo Matteotti and Giuseppe Saragat seizing the reins."
itaflv.1.a:0 "That's one less problem on the list."

itaflv.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Death of Giuseppe Peano"
itaflv.2.d:0 "On April 20th, the famous Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano died in Turin from a heart attack at the age of 73.\n\nHe is most well known in the mathematics community for creating the Peano axioms, which are named after him in his honor. He is also known for creating the auxiliary language known as ''Latino sine flexione'', which is a simplified version of Latin intended for international use. He spent most of his career teaching at the University of Torino, where he worked until the day before his death. All can agree that the mathematics community has just lost a great thinker."
itaflv.2.a:0 "We have lost a great thinker indeed."

itaflv.3.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Death of Errico Malatesta"
itaflv.3.d:0 "On July 22nd, the famous Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta died in Rome at the age of 78.\n\nHe was a friend of Mikhail Bakunin in his youth and quickly rose to prominence within the local and international anarchist community. He was arrested multiple times throughout his life, spending a decade in prison in total. He spent much of his life exiled from Italy due to his legal troubles, and only returned recently after the Great War. He was briefly arrested in 1929 by the Governo Militare, but was soon released for the same respiratory problems that led to his death in spite of efforts from doctors."
itaflv.3.a:0 "Good riddance."

itaflv.4.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Death of Carlo Petitti di Roreto"
itaflv.4.d:0 "On January 27th, the Italian army general Carlo Petitti di Roreto died in Turin at the age of 70.\n\nPetitti was born to a noble family, grandson of the famous statesman Carlo Ilarione Petitti di Roreto, a leading architect of the Risorgimento. He was best known for commanding the Italian Expeditionary Force in Macedonia from 1916 to 1917. He was also a leading commander during the Battle of the Solstice in June 1918, where the Austro-Hungarian army was decisively defeated and driven away from the Piave River. Later he served as Governor of Trieste and Venezia Giulia and as the General Commander of the Carabinieri. His accomplishments awarded him a seat in the Senate, where he was known for espousing liberal values."
itaflv.4.a:0 "You served Italy valiantly."

ITA_expand_public_works_spending:0 "Expand Public Works Spending"
ITA_expand_public_works_spending_desc:0 "Though it might seem contradictory and even dangerous to those clinging to the ideals of free market liberalism, the way to remedy this crisis in fact involves increasing our public spending by investing into businesses to make up for a lack of private investment, lowering taxes to ease the burden on our people, and building new public infrastructure such as roads and bridges."

### Ideas ###
 
ITA_Red_Decade:0 "Memories of the Red Decade"
ITA_Red_Decade_desc:0 "The ‘Red Decade’ was a period of ideological violence between the political left-wing and right-wing of the Italian populace. Starting in 1919, the Red Decade began as a result of the severe economic troubles produced in the aftermath of the Great War. These protests grew into anti-war demonstrations after the onset of the Adriatic War and the Vlora War. To counter this, members of the Italian Nationalist Association and Italian Fasces of Combat would organize formations to violently suppress protests and strikes. Violence continued even after the conclusion of the Adriatic War, and the nation would reach a breaking point with the failed coup d’etat attempt by Benito Mussolini’s National Fascist Party (PNF) in 1922. The event would retrospectively, and sarcastically, become known as the ''March on Rome''. The King, fearing the past ties Mussolini had to the socialists and unimpressed by recent fascist defeats at the hand of anti-fascist formations, while also under great pressure from military officials, would order the army to put down the fascist Blackshirts, and the PNF would be banned soon after. Tensions would reach another breaking point in 1928 when then-Prime Minister Luigi Sturzo was gunned down on his way to the parliament building. This event was blamed on the Communist Party of Italy, which had made significant gains in the 1924 elections. Elections scheduled for that year were suspended and the communists were banned in 1929 along with numerous other left-leaning parties. The nation has been under the ''Governo Militare'' ever since then. Although the period is considered to have ended in 1929, the situation seems bound to flare up once again."
ITA_Great_War_Memories:0 "Memories of the Great War"
ITA_Great_War_Memories_desc:0 "We emerged victorious alongside our allies in the Entente with the defeat of the Central Powers in the Great War. However, our victory came with a heavy cost: over a million Italian soldiers were killed, and countless others were permanently maimed and disfigured. There are many who wish to never see such tragedy occur again and are thus hesitant to send our boys off to war once more. It is commonplace for young Italian men to dodge conscription. Attempts at appeasement and reconciliation have mostly failed, and a continued lack of experience in the officer corps has only made fears worse. The follies of General Luigi Cadorna are still fresh in the minds of veterans and their families. A solution will have to be found eventually."
ITA_Army_Sympathies:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Royal Army"
ITA_Army_Sympathies_desc:0 "There are many officers within the Royal Army with ties, current or former, to the fascist movement. After the failed March on Rome, many of these officers went turncoat at the first sign of opposition to the coup by the King. While they declared their loyalty to the King, many in the Governo Militare are suspicious of these officers, who have been accused of harboring sympathies for the fascists and plotting to replace the regime. The Italian Nationalist Association (ANI), once aligned with the fascist movement until the failed coup, is often suspected as a front for the underground fascist movement, despite fervent denials from the organization's leadership and sympathies towards it from Prime Minister Pietro Badoglio. The ANI's paramilitary, the Blueshirts, are viewed with even more suspicion."
ITA_Agrarian_Economy:0 "Agrarian Economy"
ITA_Agrarian_Economy_desc:0 "Although Italy is considered a great European power, it is undeniable that, economically, we still lag behind both our allies and foes in industrialization. Over half our workers are employed in an agricultural industry that is, in many ways, still feudal. In the south, farmers generally operate under ''mezzadria'', a form of sharecropping. Modern agricultural equipment is rare, as many farmers struggle merely to survive. While there have been steps made towards industrialization, it will still take a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of cash to make significant progress. On the other hand, some believe that modernizing agriculture rather than phasing it out would be the better solution, even if only temporary. It is a problem that will, inevitably, need to be addressed."
ITA_Mezzogiorno_Problem:0 "The Mezzogiorno Problem"
ITA_Mezzogiorno_Problem_desc: "The Mezzogiorno, or Southern Italy, is the area of Italy that was conquered from the Kingdom of Two Sicilies in the infamous Expedition of the Thousand of Giuseppe Garibaldi. The locals supported unification, expecting a better life in a strong unified Italy. Now, sixty years later, the region still lags far behind the north. The southern economy is largely agrarian, devoid of modern infrastructure and industry, and socially backwards. The region, especially Sicily, is also well known for rampant organized crime, which has actively hindered economic development. Fascists have exploited these shortcomings by promising a better life to the traditionally conservative populace. The Mezzogiorno could make or break Italy in the coming years."

ITA_The_Blueshirts_desc:0 "The Blueshirts are the paramilitary organization of the Italian Nationalist Association. They are the only political paramilitary that has been allowed to operate under the Badoglio regime, and Badoglio seems to personally hold sympathies towards the ANI. This has been further solidified by Badoglio's endorsement of the Blueshirts as a ''the Arditi of our time''."

CRL_DESC:0 "The Revolutionary Liberation Committee was founded in May 1929 following the rise of the Governo Militare. Led chiefly by the banned Communist Party of Italy, the CRL adamantly opposes the monarchy and the Badoglio regime, seeking the establishment of a socialist republic through violent means if necessary. The leadership resides in exile in Germany, but clandestine cells continue to operate in Italy, inciting proletarian unrest."

While such instability was largely quashed with the rise of the Badoglio regime, Torino and Piemonte as a whole remain a centre of the anti-militarist resistance movement.§!"

ITA_influence_gui:0 "Factional Influence"
ITA_influence_gui_desc:0 "Since the rise of the §YGoverno Militare§! in 1929, there have been numerous internal factions vying for influence. Prime Minister §YPietro Badoglio§!, at the head of the regime, has sought to keep all these sides appeased.\n\nOn one side, one can find the so-called §nOrthodox Militarists§!; those in the military regime that wish to maintain the dominance of the §YRoyal Italian Army§! over Italian politics. Some even wish to cement this rule further by doing away with the Chamber of Deputies. Nonetheless, this faction is favored by the §Yliberal political parties§!.\nOn the other side, one can find the §dItalian Nationalist Association§!, a nationalist political organization that seeks to replace the military regime with a §Ycivilian-led dictatorship§! dominated by a singular political party. They have been accused of harboring sympathies for the banned §Yfascist movement§!, a charge strongly denied by the leadership.\n\nNaturally the two sides have come into conflict over their differing goals and views. While one side can be favored over the other, §Ybalance§! is always an option, albeit a difficult one. This struggle will define the future of Italy."

Based in exile in Berlin, their support is strongest in the urban industrialized north.\n\nOn the other side stands the §lRepublicans§!, organized in the §GJustice and Freedom§! freedom movement. They gather support from moderate socialists and liberal republicans, with support strongest in the northeast and Sicily."
