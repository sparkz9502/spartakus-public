bosnia.1.t:0 "A New Flag?"
bosnia.1.d:0 "The flag currently used by the ONS and the provisional government is is inspired by the flag used by Husein Gradaščević during the Bosnian Revolt in the 1830s, as well as one briefly used in 1878. The fact the flag only represents our Bosniak Muslim population is alienating Serbs and Croats whose support is crucial in these times."
bosnia.1.a:0 "Keep the crescent moon"
bosnia.1.b:0 "Use the Bosnian fleur-de-lis"
bosnia.1.c:0 "Create a new tricolor"
bosnia.1.e:0 "Represent all three nations equally"

BOSinternal.2.t:0 "Serbs Feel Ignored by Education Reforms"
BOSinternal.2.d:0 "Many Serbs are beginning to argue that, for whatever convoluted secret reason it might be, the current government is intentionally supporting education in Bosniak-majority areas while completely neglecting theirs. This is a bad sign, and if we intent to maintain a balance, we should focus on building schools in predominately Serb states as well.\n\nRemember that you can use the ethnic overlay in the decisions tab to check the ethnic composition of your states."
