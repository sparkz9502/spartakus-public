ustates.1.d:0 "Democratic Party delegates have arrived in Chicago to select their Presidential nominee, with Al Smith and Henry Ford emerging as the front-runners. Henry Ford, the previous Democratic nominee in 1928, has continued to present himself as a champion of economic prosperity, though he has been accused of sympathy with the far-right. Meanwhile, Al Smith, former governor of New York, is noted for his Catholicism and his opposition to Prohibition, which has spurred opposition from southern conservatives. The delegates cast their votes, and the nominee shall be…"

USA_booming_economy:0 "Booming Economy"
USA_booming_economy_desc:0 "Despite hardships elsewhere in the world and various issues with workers strikes, our economy has reached levels never seen before. Our isolationist and protectionist market prevented our country from being negatively affected by the London Stock Market crash in 1929. However, many warn that this abnormal boom could be the calm before the storm. Lets hope they are wrong..."

USA_tariff_act:0 "Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act"
USA_tariff_act_desc:0 "The Tariff Act of 1930, commonly known as the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, is a protectionist trade policy that places tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods. Economic analysts warn that these tariffs were unnecessary considering the booming economy, and the gradual retaliatory tariffs by our trade partners may have some unexpected consequences."

USA_impending_drought:0 "Impending Drought"
USA_impending_drought_desc:0 "§RNot taking proper precautions quick enough could lead to a major disaster.\n§!The Midwest throughout the 1920's experienced unusually rich weather with perfect rainfall and relatively moderate winter weather. However, in the summer of 1930, much of the midwest experienced extremely dry, hot weather that resulted in much of the rich soil turning to dust. 1931 saw similar conditions, and experts warn this could turn into a full blown agricultural crisis."

USA_neutrality_movement:0 "Neutrality Movement"
USA_neutrality_movement_desc:0 "We lost over 100,000 good men during the Great War, and achieved almost none of the Fourteen Points that President Woodrow Wilson created to rebuild the world after the war. He failed to establish the United States as a world power, and the idea of a League of Nations was thrown out entirely. Over a decade later, our people are still extremely unwilling to engage in any sort of conflict overseas."

USA_great_depression:0 "The Great Depression"
