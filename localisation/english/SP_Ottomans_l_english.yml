### Events ###

ott.1.t:0 "The Not-So Sublime Ottoman State"
ott.1.d:0 "Once one of the mightiest empires and richest states in the world, the Ottoman State has been reduced to it’s homeland of Anatolia. After a period of rapid modernization after the Young Turk Revolution, the Empire, under the dictatorship of Enver, Talaat, and Cemal Pashas joined the Great War on the side of the Central Powers, to the dismay of many who saw it as the ultimate undoing of the empire. Our officers were skilled and our soldiers were brave, however due to many issues with logistics and high command, as well as the endless stream of skilled and supplied British troops, the war was lost and the Empire capitulated in October 1918 after the fall of Aleppo with the Armistice of Mudros. The war also saw many atrocities being committed to Christian minorities, particularly the Armenian genocide which significantly reduced the amount of Armenians left in the Empire and famines particularly in the Levant taking a heavy toll on the local populace. A complete partition of our empire seemed imminent, yet fate it would seem prevented our dissolution."
ott.1.a:0 "Hayallah..."
ott.2.t:0 "The Exalted State After the Great War"
ott.2.d:0 "After Greeks landed in Izmir in May 1919, with rising unrest, it appeared that the very Ottoman State was collapsing, however, the news of Berlin falling to Red Forces sent a shockwave throughout the Allied Forces, causing them to quickly drop support for invading Greek forces, who without any support were forced to evacuate Izmir with fairly little damage.\n The Misak-i Milli (National Pact), a set of points for determining the future of the Ottoman State, was passed by the Ottoman parliament in February 1920, and with the Allied Powers taking a light-handed approach, the British approved of the Pact and guaranteed them, resulting in the Treaty of Sèvres, which saw them become official. The treaty also saw Kurdistan become an autonomous Vilayet and the full of integration of Christians as regular citizens under the Ottoman State. Ottomans were also forced to give reparations to Greece and Armenia however the OPDA was disbanded and while this didn’t stop exploitation of the Ottoman economy, it gave more leg-work for developing the Empire. Outside of Mosul and Kirkuk it also saw the loss of all Arab lands, causing the growth of large-scale anti-Arab sentiments and Arabs being kicked out of Antep.\n The trials of those involved in the Armenian Genocide continued with many of the perpetrators were imprisoned or executed, however Ismail Enver Pasha, dictator of the Empire during WW1 and the main mind behind the genocide, was missing and was sentenced to death in absentia, with many rumors of him hiding in Central Asia. Despite their losses, the Ottoman State, having secured its independence and the majority of its core lands, had been given a second chance and a fresh start, and was intent on not wasting it."
ott.2.a:0 "A New Beginning for the Age-old Empire?"
ott.3.t:0 "The Status Quo of the Empire"
ott.3.d:0 "The 1920s saw political domination by the Liberal Entente, through sheer popularity as well as the flaws of Ottoman democracy, and managed to pass many large-scale reforms that emancipated local Christians and saw pluralism become the norm, the abolishment of Jizya, integration into the army, and many other significant reforms saw Ottomans gain the support of the people and eased social relations, despite resistance from reactionaries and Turanists. The Liberal Entente’s rule, however, over time became stagnant as a result of their entire platform almost exclusively being based on social reforms, although industrialization sped up as a result of Rûm, along with other Christians, being fully emancipated as full citizens and freed from many of their previous burdens, there were arguably very little effective economic and political reforms, over time leading to larger and larger cracks in the Liberal Entente.\n This lack of good policy, as well as a rapidly changing cultural and political atmosphere, led to the rise of new ideas and movements. Anatolianism, which saw Turkish-speakers, Kurdish-speakers, Greek-speakers, and other peoples they claim to be Anatolian to be a part of a single culture and nationality, and as its end-goal saw this people united under a single banner. Anatolian nationalism was developed by Hilmi Ziya Ulken, a Turkish-Ottoman republican sociologist, philosopher, and historian, and through its progressive, populist, and inclusive rhetoric, Anatolianism started to gain prevalence in the post-war years from various groups and numerous people in the nation.\n Influential war hero and aspiring politician Mirliva Mustafa Kemal Pasha saw this as a way of uniting, modernizing, and mending the broken nation, and after meeting with Ulken and through his influence within the army, created the Anatolian People’s Party in 1926, managing to gain significant traction. In 1932, with the cracks in the Liberal Entente becoming ever larger, and the rise in popularity of both left-wing and right-wing rhetoric, it becomes more and more clear that the post-war status quo is at an end."
