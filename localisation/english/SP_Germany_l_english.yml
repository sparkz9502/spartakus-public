GER_Rosa_Luxemburg_trait:0 "Idol of the Revolution"

### Decisions ###
GER_the_final_conflict:0 "The Final Conflict"
GER_the_final_conflict_desc:0 "§RPoints of Conflict§! §Wwill now erupt between the major powers, opening opportunities for escalation or de-escalation. These incidents may or may not lead to war earlier, but either way there is no avoiding a war by the end of 1936.§!"
GER_the_final_conflict_mission:0 "§YThe Final Conflict Approaches§!"
GER_the_final_conflict_mission_desc:0 "1936 will prove to be the year that decides the fate of the world. Who will emerge from the ashes of war to lead the next era? Speculation now turns to preparation, as all sides prepare for battle."

GER_infrastructure_budget:0 "Infrastructure Budget"
GER_infrastructure_budget_desc:0 "The legislature has approved investments in infrastructure development, including roads, bridges, tunnels, airfields, port facilities, etc. Completing projects will add £industry_texticon  §YIndustrialization Points§!, which will be crucial for pursuing economic plans."
GER_infra_bavaria:0 "Develop Infrastructure in Bavaria"
GER_infra_bavaria_desc:0 "Although Bavaria, particularly around Munich, is an important economic area, infrastructure development is still lacking and would be useful for bringing it up to the standards of other industrial centres."
GER_infra_saxony:0 "Develop Infrastructure in Saxony"
GER_infra_saxony_desc:0 "Saxony is one of the industrial bastions of Germany and, although not particularly lacking in infrastructure modernization, could no doubt use new roads, bridges and air facilities to increase industrial efficiency."
GER_infra_rhineland:0 "Develop Infrastructure in the Rhineland"
GER_infra_rhineland_desc:0 "The Rhineland region is the foremost industrial region in Germany, and also happens to be on the frontlines with our French rivals. One could easily argue it is the most important area in all of Germany. New infrastructure developments would not only aid the expansive industry, but would also be useful for military logistics."
GER_infra_hanover:0 "Develop Infrastructure in Hanover"
GER_infra_hanover_desc:0 "The Hanover region, although poorly developed industrially, is still important economically for its ports, particularly Bremerhaven, as well as its mines. Developing the area would undoubtedly be advantageous."
GER_infra_holstein:0 "Develop Infrastructure in Holstein"
GER_infra_holstein_desc:0 "The Holstein region constitutes one of the most economically important areas in Germany, with both the port of Kiel, the Kiel Canal, and the industrial city of Hamburg being located within. Beyond economic importance, the area is strategically important and lies on the disputed front with Denmark. Investing in infrastructure would not only be beneficial economically but also for future military operations."
GER_infra_north_germany:0 "Develop Infrastructure in Northern Germany"
GER_infra_north_germany_desc:0 "Northern Germany is traditionally one of the less developed areas, being primarily based around agriculture. Stettin and Rostock constitute the few urban centres, which also happen to be notable port cities. Investing in the area will help to bring it up to the standards of Western Germany."
GER_infra_central_germany:0 "Develop Infrastructure in Central Germany"
GER_infra_central_germany_desc:0 "Central Germany constitutes a highly industrialized area, with extensive heavy industry and a healthy mining sector. In spite of this, the area falls somewhat behind industrial bastions like the Rhineland when it comes to infrastructure. Developing the area would prove useful."
GER_infra_brandenburg:0 "Develop Infrastructure in Brandenburg"
GER_infra_brandenburg_desc:0 "Brandenburg is a highly industrialized region, especially in the city of Berlin. In spite of the importance of Berlin, the periphery is notably less developed, especially in the eastern portion. The strong mining industry within the area makes infrastructural developments undoubtedly useful."
GER_infra_silesia:0 "Develop Infrastructure in Silesia"
GER_infra_silesia_desc:0 "Silesia is undoubtedly the industrial bastion of Eastern Germany, with extensive heavy industry in Breslau and a highly productive coal industry in the southeastern portion. Like the rest of the east, however, development of modern infrastructure has been neglected. It would be greatly advantageous to correct this problem."
GER_infra_east_germany:0 "Develop Infrastructure in Eastern Germany"
GER_infra_east_germany_desc:0 "Eastern Germany is one of the less developed areas, with only a handful of notable urban centres. Agriculture is dominant and the region has a large population of ethnic minorities, particularly Poles. Modernizing the infrastructure of the area would not only aid in building industry, but could also improve relations with the local populace."
GER_infra_prussia:0 "Develop Infrastructure in Prussia"
GER_infra_prussia_desc:0 "Prussia, formerly known as East Prussia, lies on the eastern fringe of German borders. Friedrich-Engels-Stadt reigns as the foremost urban centre, and holds the most important military port in the east. However, as with the rest of Germany, infrastructural development is decades behind what it should be. Furthering development in the area would be useful."

GER_fortification_budget:0 "Fortification Budget"
GER_fortification_budget_desc:0 "The legislature has approved investments in fortification development, including trench networks, bunkers, bomb shelters, minefields, coastal guns, anti-aircraft guns, etc. Completing projects will increase our £divisions §YMilitary Readiness§!, which will be crucial for preparing the Volksarmee for war."
GER_fort_rhineland:0 "Develop Fortifications in the Rhineland"
GER_fort_rhineland_desc:0 "The Rhineland stands as the main front with our French rivals, making it a likely scene of conflict in the future. The region also houses the bulk of our industry, making it crucial to protect. Though much has been done in the way of fortifying the border, there is still much to be done if we wish to be ready for the inevitable."
GER_fort_bavaria:0 "Develop Fortifications in Bavaria"
GER_fort_bavaria_desc:0 "On the Bavarian border lies the so called state of ''Baden-Württemberg'', led by illegitimate reactionary French puppets. Though we do not recognize their government, it is undeniable that they wield a large army. This area has long been considered a front of lesser importance, but the military command has increasingly called for an expansion of fortifications in the region. All that stands right now are rudimentary trenches, hardly enough to brace against a strong enemy offensive."
GER_fort_czech:0 "Develop Fortifications on the Czech Border"
GER_fort_czech_desc:0 "The revolutionary period saw the annexation of German-inhabited areas of Bohemia sought by the newly formed Czech Republic. Though the conflict ended with our control solidified over the area, the Czech government continues to refuse recognition of our governance. This, combined with their capitalistic orientation, has rendered them an enemy of Germany and the international proletariat. When the time is right, it is likely they will try to strike us, and we should ready our defenses."
GER_fort_north:0 "Develop Fortifications on the Northern Borders"
GER_fort_north_desc:0 "Though our main enemies lie to the west and south, there are nonetheless various other fronts to consider. To the north lies the Danish, who control territories we claim and who sit in striking distance of Kiel and the canal. To the northeast lies the Lithuanians, who seized the Memel region from us. Finally, to the northwest lies the Dutch, who claim neutrality in our rivalry with Britain and France but will nonetheless likely be caught up in any future conflict. We must prepare defenses for all of these fronts."
GER_fort_coast:0 "Develop Fortifications on the Coast"
GER_fort_coast_desc:0 "Though the land war is of great importance, we must not forget our vulnerabilities on the coast. We can not rule out the possibility of enemy amphibious invasions or naval bombardments. It will thus be necessary to ensure our coastal defenses are in sufficient shape to face this threat, especially in key ports such as Volkshaven and Kiel."
GER_fort_antiair:0 "Develop Anti-Aircraft Fortifications"
GER_fort_antiair:0 "The evolution of air warfare leaves cities and towns as viable bombing targets. Our enemies will surely jump at the chance to decimate our industry and terrorize our people from the skies, and this must be stopped at all costs. Though our air force will do its part, a well developed ground-based anti-aircraft network will be crucial."

GER_goals_for_the_future:0 "Goals for the Future"
GER_goals_for_the_future_desc:0 "The People's Ministry for Industry has outlined a number of goals for increasing the output of our industry in both the civilian and military sector. These goals are relatively modest and expected to be achieved within a year. Doing so will increase confidence and provide a better base for further industrial plans."
GER_military_factory_goal:0 "Increase Military Industries"
GER_civilian_factory_goal:0 "Increase Civilian Industries"

GER_industry_gui:0 "Industrialization"
GER_industry_gui_desc:0 "Germany is one of the foremost industrialized nations in the world, yet this is not enough to secure our future. We face the §Ycapitalist west§!, whose industrial might currently rivals anything that we and our allies can gather. To face them confidently in the §Rcoming revolutionary struggle§!, we must not only greatly expand our §Yindustrial capabilities§!, but also dedicate resources to aiding our allies in their own industrialization.\n\nUnfortunately, such progress cannot come out of thin air. We need resources, which can be gained through various actions. These are represented in the form of £industry_texticon  §YIndustrialization Points§!, which are spent when initiating a new project.

### Ideas ###

GER_Civil_War_Recovery:0 "Recovery from the Civil War"
GER_Civil_War_Recovery_desc:0 "The German Civil War brought all sorts of destruction to Germany. From the economy to politics to education, everything had to be rebuilt anew. Now, over a decade later, various sectors of the economy have seen major recovery and growth. However, there is still much work to be done. There are still cities where industrial output remains lower than before the civil war, while agricultural outputs have stagnated at best. Beyond just the economic effects, the German population itself is quite war weary and very apprehensive about engaging in another conflict, whether offensive or defensive."
GER_Rotfrontkampferbund:0 "Rotfrontkämpferbund"
GER_Rotfrontkampferbund_desc:0 "The Rotfrontkämpferbund (RFB) is nominally the paramilitary wing of the Communist Party (KPD). With around 300,000 members, it is an important political organisation within Germany. Its active members, known as ''fighters'', function as an auxiliary force for the army. However, the RFB is far from being combat ready in its current disorganized and poorly equipped state. Politically, it is dominated by the elements of the KPD surrounding RFB leader Ernst Thälmann, with the organization as a whole operating largely independently from the core of the party."
GER_Terrorism:0 "Right-Wing Terrorism"
GER_Terrorism_desc:0 "While the counterrevolutionary Whites lost the civil war, they continue to wage a more subtle war within our borders. There have been hundreds of attacks by right-wing militants since 1921, primarily by the shadowy group known as Organisation Consul. These attacks range from bombings to arson to sabotage to assassinations and in some cases even mass murder. This continuing issue is at best disheartening and needs to be seriously addressed."
GER_Peasant_Question:0 "The Peasant Question"
GER_Peasant_Question_desc:0 "The so called ''Peasant Question'' is one of the more outstanding issues that remain after the civil war. The original programme of the Spartakusbund laid out an ambitious plan for agrarian reform that would see immediate socialisation of agriculture and an end to the divides between the peasantry and the industrial proletariat. However, the economic devastation of the civil war brought more pressing issues. While there have been steps towards reform and socialisation, it seems more likely that an entirely new plan will be created, but some within the KPD still press for a fulfillment of the original plan."

GER_The_Mecklenburg-Pomerania_Region:0 "The Mecklenburg-\nPomerania Region"
GER_The_Mecklenburg-Pomerania_Region_desc:0 "Mecklenburg and Pomerania are both traditionally agricultural regions, with Stettin standing as the only true city of the region. Hinterpommern in particular lacks any sort of substantial industry. It would be wise to develop these areas further."
GER_The_Pomerelia-Prussia_Region:0 "The Pomerelia-Prussia Region"
GER_The_Pomerelia-Prussia_Region_desc:0 "Though Danzig stands as an important centre of naval manufacturing, the regions of Pomerelia and Prussia are generally behind the west in terms of industrial development. Prussia is largely agrarian and Friedrich-Engels-Stadt stands as more of a traditional city than anything. This can be changed, however."
GER_The_Franconia_Region:0 "The Franconia Region"
GER_The_Franconia_Region_desc:0 "Franconia is one of the traditionally less industrialized areas of the country, with farming standing as the dominant sector. What little industry exists is almost entirely based in Nuremburg and the Saxon border area around Hof. Investing in the area would be wise."
GER_The_Northwest_Region:0 "The Northwest Region"
GER_The_Northwest_Region_desc:0 "The Northwest region, based around East Frisia, Osnabrück and the former Duchy of Oldenburg, is yet another neglected region. Industry here is sparse, and almost entirely based in shipbuilding in Volkshaven and Emden. It will not be an easy task to bring this region on par with the Ruhr to the south, but with time it may be possible."
GER_The_Polish_Regions:0 "The Polish Regions"
GER_The_Polish_Regions_desc:0 "The Polish majority regions in Posen and Southern Pomerelia have long been known for being sparsely developed. What little industry exists is in the city of Posen and in Bromberg, with the countryside dominated by agriculture. This has partly contributed to right-wing opposition tendencies among the Polish population, and could be partially remedied through further expansion of industry."
GER_The_German_Bohemia_Region:0 "The German Bohemia Region"
GER_The_German_Bohemia_Region_desc:0 "Though German Bohemia was one of the industrial regions of the Austrian Empire, it was exceptionally export-based, with little in the way of heavy industry, and as a result it has struggled in this new era.

GER_Establish_the_VEGs:0 "Establish the VEG's"
GER_Establish_the_VEGs_desc:0 "The VEG (Volkseigenes Gut), or People-Owned Property, is a type of transitionary state owned farm administered by a director rather than its workers. The VEG's will be created from large and medium sized peasant holdings, which will gradually be broken up over a stated period of four years. The downsized holdings will be collectivized when the process is completed."
GER_Establish_the_OLBs:0 "Establish the ÖLB's"
GER_Establish_the_OLBs_desc:0 "The ÖLB (Örtlicher Landwirtschaftsbetrieb), or Local Agricultural Enterprise, is the new designation for already existing small peasant holdings that have not yet been collectivized. They are intended to provide a transitionary structure to facilitate voluntary collectivization through providing numerous economic incentives."
GER_A_Proletarian_Management:0 "A Proletarian Management"
GER_A_Proletarian_Management_desc:0 "While the big bourgeoisie are of course long gone, a truly proletarian management was never really instated in the farms. To solve this, the transitionary VEG's will be led by a council of farmers from each VEG, with power eventually being ceded fully to the workers."
GER_Merge_Medium_Sized_Farms:0 "Merge Medium Sized Farms"
GER_Merge_Medium_Sized_Farms_desc:0 "Many medium sized holdings are located close to eachother, especially in the northeast. This is a product of the capitalist system, which relied on inheritance and tradition rather than critical thinking. Rather than structuring each under their own VEG, it would be more wise to merge holdings where it makes sense in order to more efficiently break up the VEG's in the future."
GER_Standardize_Farming_Methods:0 "Standardize Farming Methods"
GER_Standardize_Farming_Methods_desc:0 "There are a number of problems with the current farming methods. In the north you have large but underused fields while in the south you have smaller fields divided unevenly that leave vast swaths of unclaimed but fertile land. All of this adds up to a singular issue: inefficiency. To solve this, new standards will need to be established."
GER_Lay_the_Groundwork_for_Collectivization:0 "Lay the Groundwork for Collectivization"
GER_Lay_the_Groundwork_for_Collectivization_desc:0 "Two things are being or have already been accomplished by our previous steps: a transition towards state ownership of large holdings, and an increase in agricultural effiency. Now, the next step is preparing the VEG's to be dissolved into collective farms. This will not be a rapid process, as there are many steps that need to be taken to get the best result."
GER_Expand_the_Role_of_the_Councils:0 "Expand the Role of the Councils"
GER_Expand_the_Role_of_the_Councils_desc:0 "Among the steps towards collectivization is increasing the role of the workers councils in the management of the farms. Collective farms are, after all, managed and owned by their workers, and as such it is important to train the workers for the day when a director is no longer there."
GER_Diversify_Crop_Production:0 "Diversify Crop Production"
GER_Diversify_Crop_Production_desc:0 "Crop production in Germany has always been arbitrarily regionalized. There are various places that have stuck to almost a single form of crop without reason. Farms in the north, for example, are largely wheat based, while those in the centre are based around sugar beets, and those in the south are based around fruits. To maintain a proper food supply, crop production should be diversified."
GER_Install_the_Directors:0 "Install the Directors"
GER_Install_the_Directors_desc:0 "While eventually control will be turned over to the proletariat, it is provisionally necessary to install state-appointed directors to administrate the large farms prior to collectivization."
GER_Establish_the_Kombinaten:0 "Establish the Kombinaten"
GER_Establish_the_Kombinaten_desc:0 "To increase efficiency, each large farm will be organized within a Kombinat, a collection of farms established on a regional basis. This will also allow for a certain level of input from the governing council of each Bezirk."
GER_Concentrate_the_Farms:0 "Concentrate the Farm Structure"
GER_Concentrate_the_Farms_desc:0 "There were a number of natural inefficiencies within the old bourgeois farm structure that should be eliminated. Unnecessary heirarchies should be abolished, for example, especially given the end goal is total collectivization."
GER_Collectivize_the_Medium_Farms:0 "Collectivize the Medium Farms"
GER_Collectivize_the_Medium_Farms_desc:0 "Rather than putting the medium-sized farms through the process of state ownership, it would be more wise to convert them to collective ownership. This may take some time to work out and have some negative effects, but it should prove to increase overall output."
GER_Invest_in_Modernization:0 "Invest in Modernization"
GER_Invest_in_Modernization_desc:0 "To invest in new machines is simply a half measure. Germany is a model socialist country that shall eliminate the old ways of farming entirely. Farming communities will be built from the ground up into respectable urbanized communities, and so on."
GER_Specialize_Production:0 "Specialize Production"
GER_Specialize_Production_desc:0 "In order to increase efficiency, each farm should have their production specialized. Certain farms will be designated as wheat farms, others as dairy farms, and so on. This will also have the added effect of lessening the learning burden of new inexperienced workers, who will only have to learn how to produce one product."
GER_Push_For_Voluntary_Collectivization:0 "Push for Voluntary Collectivization"
GER_Push_For_Voluntary_Collectivization_desc:0 "Marx and Engels were quite clear in their writings: collectivization of small peasant holdings should, in no circumstances whatsoever, be forced. That is not to say, however, that voluntary collectivization will be an easy process. The small peasantry remain among the more reactionary elements within our society, and will need incentives to abandon their traditions."
GER_Aid_the_Failing_Farms:0 "Aid the Failing Farms"
GER_Aid_the_Failing_Farms_desc:0 "There are a number of small peasant holdings that struggled in the aftermath of the civil war. While they have already received some limited aid that has kept most of these farms running, there needs to be a more concentrated and larger scale effort not only to fully rebuild the agricultural sector but also to win over the skeptical peasantry."
GER_Fund_Mechanization:0 "Fund Further Mechanization"
GER_Fund_Mechanization_desc:0 "The smaller peasant holdings were naturally poorer than the large holdings owned by the big bourgeoisie. As a result, few small peasants could afford to invest in modern farming equipment. This is not only inefficient but also stressful for the workers on these farms. Thus large investments into mechanization will be necessary to jumpstart this sector."
GER_Separate_Husbandry_from_Crop_Farming:0 "Separate Husbandry From Crop Farming"

The fifth child in a moderately prosperous family of timber traders, she learned to speak Polish, Russian and German at a young age, and quickly took interest in politics under the influence of her parents. During a bout of sickness that left her with a permanent limp, she taught herself to read and began writing and translating poems.\n\nHer introduction to socialist politics came in 1886, when she joined the clandestine Proletariat Party. Amidst repressions from the Tsarist authorities, she fled to Switzerland in 1888 to avoid arrest. Here, she enrolled at the University of Zurich and was first introduced to members of the German socialist movement. In 1893, she participated as a Polish delegate to the Second International. After being marginalized by the Polish Socialist Party, she would found the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL). In 1897 she moved to Germany and joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD).\n\nShe quickly rose to prominence as a leading revolutionary voice within the SPD, a position that gained her many friends and rivals. In February 1914, she was imprisoned for delivering a pacifistic speech to a crowd in Frankfurt. War erupted that year, and the majority of the SPD took the side of the German government. During her imprisonment, she co-founded the opposition 'Gruppe Internationale', which later transformed into the Spartacus League. She remained imprisoned until the outbreak of the November Revolution in 1918.\n\nFollowing her release, she quickly got to work opposing the reformist SPD government of Friedrich Ebert. On 16 January, at the congress of the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), she led the Spartacus League into a split, forming the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). She opposed putschist tendencies within the party, and ensured its participation in the 1919 elections. After an attempted putsch by right-wing extremists in April, she led the KPD into revolution in May. She assumed leadership of the provisional government during the ensuing civil war, and became the first Chairperson of the People's Council in 1921. After the 1924 elections she resigned, not wanting to set a precedent of long terms, but remained influential in other political positions. In 1930, amidst the rising issues of terrorism, agrarian reform and conflicts with the United Social Democratic Party (VSPD), she was re-elected as Chairperson.§!"

### Events ###

gerfoc.1.t:0 "Sorting Our Priorities"
gerfoc.1.d:0 "With a new year comes new plans for the state budget. Two major projects are on the table currently, and a debate has arisen in the legislature over which project to focus on first. The first plan involves infrastructure modernization and expansion, and the second plan involves an expansion of fortifications, air defenses and armories. While both projects can be completed eventually, only one can be focused on at a time.\n\nThere are a number of arguments for each side. Some believe that funding for infrastructure would do much to aid the strength of the economy, and would revitalize less developed areas such as Bavaria and the east. On the other hand, others believe our current fortifications are woefully inadequate to face the French, and with war possible at any moment they argue this needs first priority.\n\nBoth arguments have validity, but a choice must be made."
gerfoc.1.a:0 "We must work on expanding and improving infrastructure."
gerfoc.1.b:0 "We must work on constructing fortifications in preparation for war."

gerfoc.2.t:0 "Addressing the Problems Ahead"
gerfoc.2.d:0 "While socialism has brought Germany into a new age of prosperity, there are undoubtedly still issues to be sorted out.\n\nIn the south, Bavaria remains one of the most backwater regions of the country. A large section of the population sticks to traditional beliefs, opposing our regime. This has only been partially alleviated by the unique autonomous status offered to Bavaria. Combatting these tendencies and bringing Bavaria up to the standard of the rest of Germany will require a targeted campaign of industrialization and modernization, but this will take time and resources.\n\nBesides Bavaria, there are also numerous other things to address. There is the Austrian socialist government, which continues to express its discontent with our unclear position on their status as a nation. There are also a number of general goals to be established for the advancement of the German economy, which will also include ensuring the efficiency of the bureaucracy."
gerfoc.2.a:0 "So much to do!"

gerfoc.3.t:0 "The Austrian National Question"
gerfoc.3.d:0 "One of the oustanding questions is that of the ''Austrian national question'', or rather the question over whether the Austrian nation should exist at all. As it stands, the rump socialist Austrian state in Linz remains distinctly separate from Germany.\n\nThis isn't a state of affairs looked upon positively by the Austromarxist majority. In their view, Austria's historical separation from Germany was a result of its place in the multiethnic Austria-Hungary, and that in the absence of such a state the German peoples of Austria should be united with Germany as soon as possible. On the other hand, you have the minority of communists, who take a more nationalist stance, upholding Austrian history as a historical uniqueness that warrants its own status as a sovereign nation, or at the very least as a highly autonomous state within Germany.\n\nThe KPD has never taken a definitive stance here, much to the discontent of both sides. We can continue to uphold this neutrality, or we can break with tradition and embrace a side. Either way, little will change in practice until the reactionary regime in Vienna has been destroyed."
gerfoc.3.a:0 "They will join us when the time is right."

The Volksarmee and Roter Frontkämpferbund also hold grand military marches down the Karl-Marx-Allee in Berlin."

gerflv.50.t:0 "A Curious Arrival"
gerflv.50.d:0 "The border guards at the Straßenbrücke in Wiesbaden were surely surprised last night when a well dressed figure approached, hands raised, announcing themselves as ''Friedrich Ebert, the son of a traitor''. They also may not be surprised to know that this is merely the official story to be used for propaganda purposes. The son of the much hated SPD counterrevolutionary Friedrich Ebert had truly defected, but his arrival in truth came through more clandestine and perhaps less exciting means.\n\nAfter the civil war, Ebert Sr. and his family fled in exile to France. He found himself in a curious situation, hated by the left for his counterrevolutionary stance and blamed by the right for the fall of the monarchy. In spite of some opposition within the SPD, he would take up the position of President in the Paris-based exile government. He did not have long to cherish this position, however, for he would succumb to a failed appendicitis operation in February 1925.\n\nAfter his fathers death, Ebert Jr. would remain in France, while his mother and his brother Karl would move to Heidelberg in Baden-Württemberg. In the months that followed, he developed ties with a number of Parisian leftist functionaries and was approached by a German agent who offered him a chance at defection. He declined at the time. It seems, however, that he had a change of heart with the rise of the anti-socialist regime of Hubert Lyautey in May 1925. The exile government was forced to relocate to Britain, and Ebert Jr. chose to break ties with the SPD and move to the Rhenish Republic.\n\nIt seems Ebert Jr. had contemplated defection multiple times in the following years, but the rise of the Lyautey regime disrupted German intelligence networks, leaving him with little way to safely defect. In 1931 he wrote a piece in a local newspaper in Cologne, calling for reconciliation with the Free Socialist Republic of Germany. This was a seemingly intentional move, which caught the eye of German agents and prompted yet another offer for defection. This was accomplished by smuggling him through the Netherlands and hiding him on a trade ship heading for Hamburg.\n\nWhile his defection has not been announced publicly yet, it is undoubtedly one of the most high profile defections since the civil war and will surely be a propaganda victory. It is also quite certain to bring great embarassment to the exiled SPD as well as the Rhenish government. Whether Ebert plans on living a private life or entering politics remains to be seen."
gerflv.50.a:0 "Welcome home, comrade."

gerflv.100.t:0 "Der Weltkrieg"
gerflv.100.d:0 "This week, a new novel by famous German communist writer Bruno Apitz was released. Titled ''Der Weltkrieg'', it envisions an alternate world where the German Empire defeated the Entente powers in the Great War.\n\nThe novel begins in 1946, viewed from the first person perspective of a young German college student, Hans, who participates in revolutionary demonstrations in Berlin. Although specific details are spared, a few key background details are revealed: the Central Powers won the Great War, Austria-Hungary collapsed in a civil war, the Bolshevik Revolution was defeated by a German invasion, France, Italy and Britain fell to socialist revolutions, and Germany is on the brink of defeat at the hands of their alliance.\n\nThe main character, Hans, quickly witnesses the downfall of the German Empire, and Berlin is left as an open city as French and British forces parade in triumphantly. Hans, a left-wing sympathizer, soon joins the now-legalized Communist Party of Germany. It is revealed to the reader that Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were murdered in a failed revolution in 1919, and are seen as martyrs rather than leaders in this universe.\n\nHans is elected to a local workers council in the newly established German Socialist Republic, but is soon concerned by news from the east: a reactionary Russia has swept through Eastern Europe, and is preparing to wage war with the socialist bloc. Hans resigns from the workers council and enlists in the newly established German Red Army. The novel concludes as Hans prepares to head east, and it is suggested that hostilities may have already erupted. The question of the fate of Hans, the German Socialist Republic, and the socialist bloc is left uanswered.\n\nThis is Apitz's first alternative history writing, and it is unknown if he plans on writing a sequel. It is widely believed that the character of Hans was inspired by Apitz's own experiences as a revolutionary activist and soldier in the May Revolution. The novel itself has received relatively mixed reactions, but has nonetheless become the bestselling book of this week."

Forty-two works were shown, their themes mostly related to gender roles and androgyny. Höch previously became revered in the FSRD for her firmly socialist stance, harsh criticism of social democrat counterrevolutionaries, as well as her vocally bisexual orientation and activism.\n\nThe exhibition was well-attended and received, drawing expected scrutiny from reactionaries abroad."

gerpol.1.t:0 "The Free Socialist Republic of Germany"
gerpol.1.d:0 "The Free Socialist Republic of Germany was formed out of the ashes of the Great War. Amidst devastation, starvation and poverty, capitalism revealed its weakness. In November 1918, the German proletariat successfully rebelled against the reactionary imperial monarchy, seeking not only an end to a war that had claimed the lives of millions but also a more just society, free of exploitation by the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy. The road to socialism, however, was not yet clear.\n\nIn the way of the proletariat stood the two-faced Social Democrats led by Friedrich Ebert, who would claim to represent the proletariat just as they collaborated with reactionary paramilitaries to murder them. In January 1919, the Communist Party was formed. The strikes of that year would see the Social Democrats reveal their true nature to the proletariat, betraying workers at every turn in favor of the counterrevolution. Even their greatest efforts, however, could not destroy the revolutionary spirit. Millions of workers expressed their will in the strike of May 1st 1919, known later as the May Revolution.\n\nWhat followed was a brutal but inevitable civil war. The struggle with the forces of the counterrevolution was one that claimed the lives of millions. In the end, however, the forces of Hindenburg and Ebert struggled to unify, and they were driven back to the banks of the Rhine by November 1920. The end of the civil war came with yet another price, however, for the forces of the Entente too opposed us. The Treaty of Aachen was signed, leaving the Rhineland and Baden-Württemberg under hostile occupation for the time being.\n\nIt is now 1932. The recovery from both the Great War and the civil war is still underway, though much progress has been made. We are the strongest socialist state in the Comintern, while our ties remain strong with the Soviet Union and other revolutionary states. Ahead lies an inevitable conflict with the capitalist west, and much needs to be done to prepare."

gerpol.2.t:0 "A Fragile Balance"
gerpol.2.d:0 "The United Social Democratic Party (VSPD), formerly the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), is a close ally of the Communist Party. However, it remains divided between two distinct wings, which ultimately calls back to the age old question of reform versus revolution.\n\nOne side of the party is the ''Ledebour-Gruppe'', based around Georg Ledebour and his supporters, such as Ernst Däumig, Emil Barth and Otto Grotewohl. This wing is unapologetically revolutionary and, aside from occasional differences and disagreements, generally supportive of close cooperation with the KPD. On a local level, this wing is more represented in urban councils.\n\nOn the other side is the ''Crispien-Gruppe'', based around Arthur Crispien and his supporters, such as Wilhelm Dittmann, Richard Lipinski and Karl Kautsky. This wing officially aligns itself with the Marxist centre, neither fully supporting nor opposing revolution and reformism. In practice, however, this wing represents the old guard moderate reformists previously led by Hugo Haase. On a local level, this wing is more represented in rural councils.\n\nAt the moment, neither wing is particularly dominant. Although the revolutionaries were traditionally more dominant, especially during the revolution, they have been weakened by the departure of many of its members to the KPD.\n\nAlthough there will undoubtedly be policy differences that will have to be overcome, it will be important to be mindful of shifts within the leadership of the VSPD, which will undoubtedly be influenced by the positions of the KPD. The dominance of either wing will impact whether policies can be implemented with or without the support of the VSPD, and in some cases it may be even be necessary to have the support of the VSPD to democratically pass policies."

gerpol.3.t:0 "The Seat of the Legislature"
gerpol.3.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the socialist republic, there has been a desire to construct a new building to house the two federal legislative bodies: the Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils and the Congress of Ministers. Currently both bodies are housed in the former Reichstag building. In the wake of the devastation of the civil war there was little time and money to be spent on addressing the issue, despite the pleas of many great architects.\n\nThe issue comes down to two choices: whether to rebuild anew, or renovate the existing building. The architects of the Staatliches Bauhaus have made it clear that they want a new building. To them the Reichstag building is a relic of a reactionary and dated era no longer relevant to modern Germany. On the other hand there are those who argue starting from scratch is economically naïve. Instead they propose expansions and renovations for the existing building."
gerpol.3.a:0 "Tear it down and start over! This is a perfect opportunity for our great architects."

gerpol.10.t:0 "1933 Council Elections"
gerpol.10.d:0 "The November 1933 elections to the councils has commenced. The process will last seven days from Sunday the 12th to Saturday the 18th. Today, the populations of each municipality will elect a local council, and tomorrow those councils will elect a provincial council. The process will continue from there until both the Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils and the Congress of Ministers have been elected. All elected delegates can be removed via a recall vote at any time.\n\nThere will be a number of issues that will factor into the elections, which are heavily influenced by the workers, peasants and soldiers councils. There is the state of the economy and the ongoing post-civil war recovery efforts to consider, as well as a number of other domestic issues like the recent bombings. There is also some concern over the power of the Rotfrontkämpferbund, the autonomous paramilitary of the communist party.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that the positions of Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson will be challenged, it seems likely that there will be a number of changes within the minister cabinet due to complaints from the workers councils. Among those facing a tough reelection challenge is Walter Ulbricht, the infamous hardline foreign minister from the KPD who is viewed with suspicion even by some of his party comrades."

gerpol.11.t:0 "The Peasant Question"
gerpol.11.d:0 "With the 1933 elections concluded and the new deputies having taken their places, Chairwoman Rosa Luxemburg has stepped forward for the first joint assembly of the Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies and the Congress of Ministers since the election. She will be giving a speech in which she argues for a so called ''New Agrarian Policy'' to resolve the outstanding question of how to socialize the agricultural sector. The plan first involves gradually breaking up larger peasant holdings, then creating economic incentives for small-holding peasants in order to achieve voluntary collectivization. Her plan is expected to receive support from many members of the VSPD.\n\nThis contrasts with the original plan of the KPD, drafted by herself in 1918, which described the immediate collectivization of large and medium agricultural enterprises and a rapid transition towards industrialized agriculture. The destruction of the civil war introduced a period of economic hardship that forced a compromise with the peasantry, and the fate of the collectivization question remained unaddressed until now.\n\nOf course, this new plan has its opponents, especially within the KPD. The clique around Ernst Thälmann has vocally opposed a new plan, demanding the fulfillment of the original 1918 plan. Their position has the support of some ''ultraleft'' members of the KPD aligned with the councilist faction. Thälmann himself has asked to speak to the congress before Luxemburg, presumably to voice his opposition."

gerpol.11.b:0 "Luxemburg shall speak first as planned."

gerpol.12.t:0 "Thälmann Speaks"
gerpol.12.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, Comrade Thälmann was granted the right to speak ahead of Chairwoman Luxemburg on the topic of the peasant question. As he approached the podium, he was greeted with applause from a small group of communists. There was a brief pause as he adjusted his tie and cleared his throat, as many in the congress spoke among themselves and ignored the marginalized Rotfrontkämpferbund leader. Those who knew Thälmann, however, knew to never underestimate his fervor.\n\n''Comrades, we gather today for a very important reason. The issue at hand is one of great importance, one that could very well shape the future of the global proletariat. In 1919, the German workers took up arms against their oppressors. These revolutionary heroes smashed the rule of the bourgeoisie and crushed the traitorious forces of the reaction. They did this believing it would lead to socialism, to democracy, to the rule of the proletariat. In 1918, the Spartacist League promised to dismantle the bourgeoisie through whatever means necessary. To captitulate to the peasantry, the very root of the reaction, is to betray our principles and our promises! The peasantry, the core of the petty bourgeoisie, would love nothing more than to return to the days of the Hindenburg dictatorship. It is for this reason that we must not let our guard down by appeasing our enemies. Those here that genuinly serve the will of the proletariat will denounce this so called ''New Agrarian Policy'' and fight instead for the legacy of the May Revolution.''\n\nApplause errupted yet again, but this time across the entire congress. One could not deny the convincing argument of Comrade Thälmann. Even the staunchest loyalists could not help but wonder if they were wrong on the agrarian issue. This will undoubtedly complicate the upcoming vote."

gerpol.19.t:0 "A New Anthem?"
gerpol.19.d:0 "Among the more minor debates recently has been over whether or not the anthem should be changed. The current anthem, Die Internationale, is a universal anthem of the international proletariat. Some have opposed its usage, seeing it as lacking a German identity. There have been proposed alternatives, most notably Auferstanden aus Ruinen and Solidaritätslied. \n\nAuferstanden aus Ruinen, written by Johannes Becher and Hanns Eisler in 1922, is a popular song that describes a Germany risen from the ruin of the civil war. Some have opposed its usage as an anthem, however, for its allegedly nationalistic nature. Solidaritätslied, written by Bertolt Brecht and Hanns Eisler in 1929, represents the revolutionary struggle of the international proletariat. Some have supported its usage as a modern version of Die Internationale."

Such a new strategy could, however, be politically costly to implement as it would mean temporarily curbing freedoms to crush the influence of these underground groups.\n\nEven so, there are clear benefits to taking this course of action. Our own intelligence officials have been warning of threats to the safety of multiple politicians including Chairwoman Rosa Luxemburg. Not attending to the situation may have disastrous results in the future.\n\nWe must respond soon, so the choice has to be made now."

The target was the Stadtschloss, the infamous building from where Karl Liebknecht declared the Free Socialist Republic of Germany in November 1918. Although a few minor injuries were reported, it seems no one has been killed, likely due to the detonation taking place so early in the morning.\n\nAlthough the perpetrator or perpetrators have not been identified so far, the bombing comes at a peculiar time, just as investigators are looking into the string of murders committed by right-wing underground groups.

Although many bridges were destroyed as per the terms of the Treaty of Aachen in 1920, the Maibrücke is one of a few that remained.\n\nThe incident occured during a relatively common prisoner exchange. A drunken Rhenish border guard detained two weeks ago after stumbling towards a German guard station was exchanged for three German sailors detained a month ago after their malfunctioning patrol boat drifted onto the Rhenish bank of the river.\n\nFor unclear reasons, shots were fired shortly after the prisoners were exchanged. Two German soldiers were wounded in the initial moments, while Rhenish casualties remain unknown. Regardless, both sides retreated to their respective ends of the bridge almost immediately. The incident soon escalated when artillery volleys were fired by both sides across the heavily militarized border. It is also unclear who fired first in this case.\n\nAttempts were made to negotiate a ceasefire over official diplomatic telephone channels, but no response was heard from the Rhenish side. While the fighting has ended for now, it seems likely that hostilities will resume if no diplomatic solution is achieved soon."
