UAE_trucial_council:0 "Trucial States Council"
UAE_trucial_council_desc:0 "The Trucial States are a group of tribal confederations that came under the protection of the British Empire. The protectorate lacks central authority; instead, a council acts as a forum for the various rulers to exchange views and agree on internal policies."
UAE_lobsters:0 "Declining Pearl Industry"
UAE_lobsters_desc:0 "Once a flourishing industry, pearl hunting in the Persian gulf has become a mere shadow of its former self. Thanks to growing artificial pearl farming in Japan, many coastal towns and villages in the Trucial States are experiencing economic decline."
