### Ideas ###

GRE_Political_Factionalism:0 "Political Factionalism"
GRE_Political_Factionalism_desc:0 "The decleration of the young Republic in 1924 proved to be one of the most divisive event in modern Greek history. The two largest factions, the ruling liberal Venizelists, and the conservative Oppositionists constantly fight due to disagreements in the developement of the economy, military intervention in politics and, most importantly, the question of the monarchy. With the two factions being neck and neck in competing for power and far-left and far-right parties growing, the Republic's future looks short."
GRE_Booming_Economy:0 "Booming Economy"
GRE_Booming_Economy_desc:0 "The large reparations in capital and raw materials, flexible labour laws and large-scale industrial developement has led to the largest economic growth our nation has ever seen. The banking system has grown, the population in the cities has grown to a substantial amount when compared to the countryside, light and medium industry has grown exponentially and the first Greek heavy industry has been created. But, as the saying goes: "The higher the rise, the harder the fall"."
GRE_Divided_Military:0 "Divided Military"
GRE_Divided_Military_desc:0 "The military is very involved in the nation's politics. Generals are important politicians and the major factions use the military to achieve political goals. As a result, the military is split between the Venizelists and the Monarchists. This has plauged the military with factionalism, inefficiency of command and corruption, but no administration has proven capable of fixing this issue, instead focusing on strenghtening their faction and weakening the enemy one."
GRE_Foreign_Debts:0 "Foreign Debts"
GRE_Foreign_Debts_desc:0 "Ever since the inception of the modern Greek state in the great revolution of 1821, the country has been plagued by large foreign debts to the great powers, most importantly the United Kingdom. In the wake of the London Stock Market Crash in 1929, those creditors have been more and more ruthless towards Greece for the ratio and size of payments. Venizelos' strategy of using the Greek gold reserves to avoid damage to the economy by the crash and the payments has worked, but it has drained them and left Greece vulnerable to another economic crisis."

GRE_Gold_Standard_yes_idea:0 "Retention of the Gold Standard"
GRE_Gold_Standard_yes_idea_desc:0 "With the Great Powers supporting antithetical policies, there was much debate over whether or not to keep the Drachma based on the gold standard.

From a young age he started working as a worker in Regie, in Nikomedia and in 1919 in the port of Instanbul. In Nikomedia, 1918, he was fist introduced to socialism by a Cypriot interpreter. Soon, he became involved with socialist groups such as trade unions and visited the USSR and the FSRD, and in 1923, he studied in the KUTV.\n\nIn 1924, he moved in Greece and joined the SEKE(K) as a high-ranking member of the communist faction led by Pantelis Pouliopoulos, which would soon oust the "petty-bourgeois elements" out of the party. He would also be one of the most staunch opponents of the ultra-left Archeio-Marxists. Through that conflict, Zachariadis became one of the most important members of the party.\n\nYears later, in 1931, together with Andronikos Haitas, led a group of members called "The Bolshevik Faction" against the party leadership and the majority of the party (which was unofficialy named "The Spartacist Faction") and its belief of a socialist revolution in Greece, believing the country was in need of a Burgeois-Democratic one, due to the supposed underdeveloped nature of Greek capitalism.

When he was released, four months later, he was unanimously elected as General Secretary of the KKE, but he refused to assume office and Patsias Giatsopoulos, a close ally of him, would assume the secretaryship.

greflavour.1.t:0 "The Founding of the Hellenic Republic"
greflavour.1.desc:0 "The decade after the Great war was one of great political change for Greece. The nation was dragged into the war by the then Prime Minister Elefthérios Venizélos, with the promise of the fullfiment of the Megali Idea, the liberation of Greeks living in foreign lands by the expansion of the Greek state. But due to Britain’s desire to establish a stable puppet in the area of the Ottoman Empire, Greece gained very little in terms of territorial expansion and was blocked from militarily expanding eastwards. Since Venizelos dragged the already war-tired populace to the war with the promises of the fulfillment of the Megali Idea, his failure at the negotiating table resulted in a drastic fall of public support for him and his government. This resulted in his temporary retirement from politics, which helped push the Liberals' Party towards anti-monarchism, a sentiment that was only strenghtened by the enthroning of the anti-Venizelist George II. This situation culminated in Venizelist elements in the army, led by Nikolaos Plastiras and Stylanos Gonatas, successfully overthrowing the government and establishing a Republic with Venizelos as its head in early 1924.\n\nThis actions infuriated most of conservative Greece, resulting in political instability, a situation that was taken advantage by the general Theodoros Pangalos, who in 1925 started a coup d'état aimed at the retirement of the Michalakopoulos government and the formation of a new government headed by him. Due to his movement succeeding across Greece, president Kountouriotis had no choice than to appoint him Prime minister. Although he initially presented himself as the leader of the republic, Pangalos quickly abandoned democracy with him abolishing the parliament which “had lost the trust of the nation”, placing himself as the sole ruler of the country. His dictatorship lasted for only a year, with him being overthrown and executed by general Kondylis on the 21st of August 1926. In his place, a series of governments ruled the country until Venizelos was reelected in 1928.\n\nVenizelos’ government has had to face a steady growth of a conservative, pro-monarchist opposition, under the Peoples’ Party of Panagis Tsaldaris. In the last years, the Venizelists and Anti-Venizelists in Greece have culminated around these parties, who have been competing for power in the parilament. With elections on the horizon, Greece has once again been divided into two. Furthermore, a growing monarchist faction in the army, centered around Georgios Kondylis, has challenged the ability of the liberals to use the army to overthrow opposing governments. The far-left and right have also been growing, with nationalistic sentiment roaring and the communist ideology spreading due to industrialization and the multiple revolutions in Europe. The next few years will come to show the fate of the struggling nation."

greflavour.2.t:0 "The Greek Economy"
greflavour.2.desc:0 "An undeniable effect of the war is that it aided the liberals' goal of modernising the Greek economy along the lines of the capitalist system. Specifically, the war secured large Ottoman reparations in money and resources, which, along with the consistent drop in the wages of Greek workers, resulted in led to the largest economic growth the modern Greek state has seen, over the last decade. The industrial economic boom has turned Greece from a largely agrarian country, to one with a sizable part of its population living in urban centers and a substantial part of it being workers.Greek industry is largely light, made up by the maritime, textile, tobacco, construction, metallurgy and food processing industries. The economic boom, however has given rise to the first Greek heavy industries in major cities, specifically in steel and infrastructure.\n\nFor the last decade, the Greek government has been executing a land reform aimed at the destruction of the “Tsiflikia”, remnants of feudalism in Greece, and the passing of the agricultural economy into petty-bourgeois hands through redistribution of farmland with compensation. This process, however, has been slow, with a third of the tsiflikia still remaining. Furthermore, the previous landowners and various banks and rich farmers have essentially created for the poor farmers similar living conditions to the workers in industry, with them often having to take loans to pay for compensations and to survive competition and financial ruin, and/or work on other farms in exchange for wages.\n\nEver since the inception of the Greek state in 1821, it has consistently taken a series of loans in order to help the country militarily and/or financially. Thus, Greece has had to constantly pay off debts towards the countries it loaned from, mainly Britain and France. With the crash of the London Stock Exchange, Greece’s imports and exports were seriously hurt, and Britain became much more strict and demanding concerning the frequency and size of debt payments. Venizelos’ policy of using the Greek gold reserves to mitigate the damage that would have been done to the economy and the upper and upper-middle classes, which make the base of his support, has worked, but has also left the country vulnerable to another economic crisis."

The depletion of our gold reserves by the Prime Minister to alleviate the effects of the previous economic crisis has left us vulnerable to the present one and exposed to the full negative effects.\n\nThe crash and the upcoming drop in living conditions is also expected to further in the radicalisation of the Greek people, with the communists agitating against capitalist instability."

The Venizelos’ government, who was historically pro-war, had declared illegal every demonstration for that date. Despite the ban, many rallies and peaceful demonstrations were organised and happened in Athens, Piraeus and Thessaloniki. Naturally, the law enforcement agencies intervened and violently dissolved the protests. This chain of events also happened in a part of Piraeus called Drapetsona, where in the extensive arrests that followed, the police apprehended KKE executive Kostas Sarikas, with the police officer Gyftodimopoulos taking him to the nearest police station of the area. Bezantakos and a group of protesters tried to free him and Gyftodimopoulos shot at them. Bezantakos then lost his temper, pulled out a revolver and killed the officer.\n\nThe authorities accused Bezantakos, Sarikas and the other protesters for this murder. After evading the police for a few days, he was arrested in Marousi and interrogated. During those interrogations, Bezantakos refuted the allegations by the police, (that the other protesters shot at Gyftodimopoulos), taking full responsibility. The authorities then transferred him to Sygrou prison in order to pass him on trial for murder in April 1932. It was then that the KKE Politburo decided to break him out of jail. With connections that the Party had, it made sure to transfer Bezantakos to the cell of Nefeloudis and Marmarelis, two KKE executives. Bezentakos began to pretend to be sick. Yesterday, Bezantakos, didn’t show up for morning call (something that was forgiven due to his “ill state”). He was, in fact, locked in the bathroom and after the invitation he slowly and methodically starts tearing down the wall. At the same time, in the cell under the covers, logs have been stacked in the shape of the human body for deception. On the night of the 4th to the 5th the wall has been drilled and Bezentakos jumped into the void. Members of the KKE are waiting for him from below.\n\nHe is now fleeing to the Soviet Union along with other persecuted communists.

The other side proposes the use of the stock market, buying bank stocks at higher than average prices and selling low. They argue that securing the financial pillar of agriculture would be hard on the economy in the short-term, but the greater ability to loan would allow for a quicker recovery.\n\nThere have been many arguments, both in the halls of parliament and inside our administration, the rapid changes in the economy have forced us to make a choice."
