RHI_French_Oversight:0 "French Oversight"
RHI_French_Oversight_desc:0 "The French undeniably hold significant sway over our nation, if it can even be called that. They appoint the presidency and maintain significant influence in politics and the economy through the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission, which has been dominated by the French and their Belgian allies ever since the withdrawal of the British and Americans from our affairs. A large amount of our industry is under the control of foreign corporations or otherwise operates under significant French influence, leaving little under the control of Rhenish Germans. Additionally, the French have absolute authority over our foreign policy, making any sort of independent diplomacy impossible. There may be room in the future to negotiate these terms and expand our freedoms, but it is unknown to what extent."
RHI_Military_Restrictions:0 "Military Restrictions"
RHI_Military_Restrictions_desc:0 "As one of the preconditions for our limited autonomy the French have restricted our military to a small force of 30,000 soldiers organized in five ''Protection Divisions''. They are meant to function both as a wartime auxiliary defensive force and a domestic policing force, but their practical use is limited. If we wish to have a stake in the coming conflict and ensure our survival these restrictions must be lifted, but it will take some convincing to get the French to relent, who were already reluctant enough to allow the Baden-Württemberger army."
RHI_Heirs_of_Weimar:0 "Heirs of Weimar"
RHI_Heirs_of_Weimar_desc:0 "Although nominally a separatist state, the Rhenish Republic is undoubtedly the closest heir to the Weimar Republic and the liberal republican vision. Many prominent politicians from that era are active in our political scene and continue to advocate for the return of the republican system, and the Weimar government-in-exile holds significant influence. The French have little interest in these ambitions but have not taken any significant actions to suppress this sentiment thus far, and it also remains to be seen how practical an embracement by our government of such positions would actually be."
RHI_The_Artaman_League:0 "The Artaman League"
RHI_The_Artaman_League_desc:0 "The Artaman League is a rising far-right force in the Rhenish Republic, chiefly led by Richard Walther Darré. Though not a political party, it represents a radical sect within the German nationalist right. Blending agrarianism and a rejection of urban life with anti-French rhetoric, it has gathered a large following particularly among Protestant farmers in the Palatinate, as well as refugees who fled to the Rhineland during the German Civil War. Strongly anti-communist, they regard urban life to be the roots of communism, and seek to fight back against what they perceive as a Slavicization of Germany since the Great War. Though only a nuisance for the moment, the Artaman League continues to grow, taking advantage of economic downturn and growing anti-French sentiment, leaving a very real prospect that they could grow into a true threat if the roots of their success are not sufficiently addressed."
