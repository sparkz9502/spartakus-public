uk.0.t:0 "The United Kingdom"
uk.0.desc:0 "After the armistice in 1918 and the wave of revolutions across Russia and the former Central Powers, the Allied nations found ourselves facing no longer the threat of war, but the threat of revolution. The Irish Republicans had risen up against English rule, our own populace was war-weary, and our economy was stagnating. It seemed as though revolution was spreading across Europe.\n\nThe war in Ireland came to an abrupt end with an independent massacre of IRA leaders by the military, which led to the fall of the coalition government in 1922. The new Liberal-Labour coalition negotiated an end to the conflict, but the coalition would only last a year. Since then, Labour has been unable to recover. \n\nTotal stability has never truly returned to Britain. After the crash of the London Stock Exchange in 1929, many lost all hope of our economy ever truly recovering. Finally, though, the crisis appears to be coming to an end. The British Empire will soon be as strong as ever, and the communist threat will be no more."
uk.0.a:"Rule, Britannia!"
uk.1.t:0 "Effects of Wall Street Reach Britain"
uk.1.desc:0 "The crash of the New York Stock Exchange has rattled the world, and we are beginning to feel its effects in Britain. Our economy, which we all believed would finally recover in the coming years, will soon reach new depths. \n\nSome worry that this will spark a renewed socialist movement in Britain, but others look in another direction. The last election saw several unexpected victories for right-wing independents and minor parties, and with the worsening situation, more may turn towards their more radical methods."
uk.1.a:0 "Surely such talk is exaggerated."
uk.2.t:0 "The National Union of Britons"
uk.2.desc:0 "Today marks the formation of a new political party: the National Union of Britons. Although this would not be especially notable under ordinary circumstances, it is the result of a merger of several minor parties as well as a number of independent right-wing politicians holding seats in parliament. Although diverse in their ideas, its members have determined that their goals would be better pursued under a single banner, and their support will only grow from this point on."
uk.2.a:0 "They will surely never amount to much."


ukforeign.14.t:0 "The Kuomintang Seize Macau!"
ukforeign.14.d:0 "With the unfortunate defeat of the Monarchist forces in the recent Civil War in Portugal, the Kuomintang in China have seized the port of Macau. The port had been under Portuguese control for centuries, and many believe that allowing a Chinese takeover of the port would compromise negotiations in the future regarding Hong Kong. What should we tell them?"
ukforeign.14.a:0 "We had treaties for this you know!?!"
ukforeign.14.b:0 "Let them have their useless land..."

# Ideas
UK_the_irish_question_idea:0 "The Irish Question"
UK_the_irish_question_idea_desc:0 "The Anglo-Irish War ended a decade ago, but it was a Pyrrhic victory at best. Our government and the remnants of the IRA came to an uneasy truce after a series of brutal operations conducted by a rogue commander resulted in dozens of Irish deaths and a crisis in parliament. Amid infighting and public outcry, our government fell apart, and after the elections that brought our first and only Liberal-Labour coalition government into power, we gave the Irish a modicum of autonomy within our glorious Empire. \nSome, however, remain dissatisfied with this uneasy conclusion to the conflict—both within the government, and among the public. Patriotic Britons know that someday soon, we will crush the rebellious republican movement and bring Ireland back into the fold. Meanwhile, though, tensions are rising once again in Ireland, and the Irish government, while mostly under our control, seems either unwilling or unable to quash civil unrest."
UK_recovering_economy:0 "Recovering Economy"
UK_recovering_economy_desc:0 "The London Stock Exchange Crash of 1929 hit our country in an already-troubled time, halting our slow recovery from the financial strain of the Great War and after. Unemployment is high, and especially in the more industrial areas of the nation, the lower classes agitate for change. We are finally recovering, though, and we will soon move into a new era of prosperity for the Empire!"
UK_pacifism:0 "Pacifism"
UK_pacifism_desc:0 "The British nation is tired of war. Following the Great War, and the ensuing overseas interventions and conflict in Ireland, the nation has come to revile war as a means to further British interests. For the people, our national interests are best served by preserving international peace. \nThat said, the British Empire was not built through peace, and peace may not be sufficient to preserve it. In addition, many fear that the communist powers are becoming too strong, and that soon, the enemies of the Empire will be at our doorstep, and the final struggle will commence."
UK_hawkish_military_command:0 "Hawkish Military Command"
UK_hawkish_military_command_desc:0 "At odds with the public opinion, the military is vigilant in protecting British interests abroad, and will push to intervene wherever possible. Restricted by the government as they are, their activities are limited, but this could soon change."

# Leader descriptions
POLITICS_George_V_DESC:0 "King George V has ruled through a tumultuous period. His reign has seen the beginning and end of the Great War, the rise of communism, and the gradual devolution of the British Empire. In the aftermath of the war and the ensuing revolutions in Europe, his cousins, Kaiser Wilhelm and Tsar Nicholas, were deposed. \n\nHe has often called for leniency towards his more unruly subjects, such as the socialists and nationalists in Ireland and India, and during the general strike of 1926. \n\nSince the war, George has worked to rehabilitate the public's view of the monarchy and reconcile with the British labour movement. Due to this calming influence, he has calmed tempers and led his governments towards compromise. The monarchy, as long as he sits on the throne, appears safe. \n\nGeorge's health has been ailing these past years, however, and many expect his reign to end soon. His son Edward is expected to succeed him, but George seems reluctant to pass the empire to him. The coming years may be difficult for the British crown...."
