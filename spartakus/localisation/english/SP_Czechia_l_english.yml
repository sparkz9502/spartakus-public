cze.0.t:0 "The Czech Republic"
cze.0.desc:0 "The Czechoslovak Republic was born in a period of turmoil. Originally claiming the German-inhabited regions of Bohemia as well as Slovakia, the Czechoslovak National Council had fought hard for the establishment of a Czechoslovak state, and thousands of Czechs served in the Czechoslovak Legion against the Central Powers in the Great War. Before they were able to fully consolidate their rule over the whole of the country, however, the Hungarian communists conquered Slovakia, and shortly after, the Bohemian Germans rose up and joined the German Red Army. Overwhelmed on all sides, the government decided to focus on protecting their Czech lands, and signed a truce with the communists. \n\nSince then, Czech democracy has been stewarded by the guiding hand of President Masaryk. The ruling coalition, the Pětka or Committee of Five, has overwhelming control of the National Assembly, and continues to cooperate for the good of the nation. \n\nSome worry, though, that Masaryk's age will compel him to withdraw from politics over the coming years, and such an event may spell the end of the Pětka. Most Czechs cannot even fathom such a thing, but they may be faced with the unthinkable soon enough."

cze.1.t:0 "The Great Depression Reaches Czechia"
cze.1.desc:0 "It was only a matter of time before the effects of the Wall Street Crash would reach Czechia. Our primary trading partners are already feeling the effects, which has had an immediate impact upon our markets. Imports are slowing, and it seems that we may be left even more economically isolated than we already are."
cze.1.a:0 "This is a dark day for the Czech Republic."
cze.2.t:0 "Independent Czechoslovak State Day"
cze.2.desc.a:0 "28 October is the anniversary of the Czechoslovak National Council taking power in Prague in 1918. It is a day of nation-wide celebration - but also a day of mourning our lost territories, and for dreaming of the day when all the rightful Czechoslovak lands are reunited under our banner."
cze.2.desc.b:0 "28 October is the anniversary of the Czechoslovak National Council taking power in Prague in 1918. As we fight to reclaim our rightful territory, our soldiers are filled with a renewed sense of purpose."
cze.2.desc.c:0 "28 October is the anniversary of the Czechoslovak National Council taking power in Prague in 1918. It is a day of nation-wide celebration - especially since having made Czechoslovakia whole once more. As grand celebrations are held in the cities and throughout the countryside, our government has also taken the initiative to organise special events in our recently liberated territories to commemorate the occasion."
cze.2.a:0 "Pravda vítězí!"
cze.3.t:0 "Our Priorities"
cze.3.desc:0 "It has become clear that we must invest considerably in the nation in order to salvage our economy, even if it means our government will go into debt. There are two areas that require our attention: industry and agriculture. \n\nAlthough Bohemia was the industrial heartland of Austria-Hungary, a large part of our industry in the German-populated areas was stolen away by the German communists during the revolutionary fervour of 1919. We still have a considerable industrial capacity, but it requires investment in order to grow and bring our economy back to acceptable levels. \n\nThe Bohemian lands have never been an agricultural centre, however, and the vast agricultural lands of Slovakia - rightfully ours - were also conquered in 1919. Since then, our populace has been subject to constant rationing. Although food imports have helped to alleviate the crisis since the end of the chaos of the revolutionary period, it is crucial that we increase our own agricultural output. \n\nWe can only address one of these issues at a time. Which will we address first?"
cze.3.a:0 "We will prioritise industry."
cze.3.b:0 "We will prioritise agriculture."
cze.4.t:0 "Death of the Iron Rector"
cze.4.desc:0 "August Naegle, the German \"Iron Rector\" of Charles University, was found dead this morning after passing peacefully in his sleep. \n\nCharles University is the oldest university in Czechia, and was one of the most prominent in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the late 19th century, the institution was split into the German university and the Czech university, to satisfy ethnic tensions, but with the fall of the empire and the foundation of the Czech Republic, the question of which language would dominate the institution was revived. \n\nFor years, the university has been caught between the two camps: the minority Germans, who still hold a fair amount of sway over the institution, and the majority Czechs. The crux of the conflict: the insignia of the original university, officially shared between the two, but now claimed by both the German and Czech faculties as their own. \n\nAugust Naegle had been instrumental in maintaining the German university, and with his death, there are rumblings among the faculty once more. Ethnic tensions have for years been kept at bay in the Czech Republic, but some worry that this will spark renewed conflict."
cze.4.a:0 "How fierce can academics really get?"
cze.5.t:0 "Masaryk suffers a stroke!"
cze.5.desc.a:0 "President Masaryk has suffered a stroke! He is already recovering well, but some whisper that this may spell the definitive end of his political career. Although he has expressed in the past that he does not wish to stand for for a fourth term in the upcoming presidential election, and hopes that his protégé Edvard Beneš may succeed him, Beneš may not have enough support within the parliament to maintain the status quo if Masaryk steps down. \n\nWith this event bringing these worries back to the surface, it is time to make a definitive statement on the matter. Will Masaryk stand for another election?"
cze.5.desc.b:0 "Former President Masaryk has suffered a stroke. Although he is recovering, this is a great blow to the forces of \"democracy\" in the Czech Republic. Masaryk was always the government's uniting force, and without such a strong figure for the various parties to look to in common, they will never unite to oppose us."
cze.5.a:0 "Yes, Masaryk will stand once more."
cze.5.b:0 "No, this will be Masaryk's last term."
cze.5.c:0 "With this, the \"democratic\" opposition to our regime is weakened."


cze.10.t:0 "1934 Presidential Election"
cze.10.desc.a:0 "President Masaryk's third term has come to an end, and with it, a new presidential election has been called. The President is elected by the bicameral parliament of 300 Deputies and 150 Senators, and needs 60% of the vote in order to be elected. \n\nMasaryk is now 84 years old, and would have liked his protégé Edvard Beneš to succeed him. Beneš's support within the parliament is tenuous however, so Masaryk has stood once more for election in order to maintain the political status quo. There is no meaningful opposition to him."
cze.10.desc.b:0 "President Masaryk's third term has come to an end, and with it, a new presidential election has been called. The President is elected by the bicameral parliament of 300 Deputies and 150 Senators, and needs 60% of the vote in order to be elected. \n\nDue to his ailing health at 84 years, Masaryk has declined to stand for a fourth term. His preferred successor is his protégé, Edvard Beneš of the National Socialists (ČSNS). However, Beneš may prove to lack sufficient support to be elected. He is supported by the Social Democrats (ČSDSD) and the Populars (ČSL). \n\nThe Agrarian Party (ČSA) has nominated Bohumil Němec. He is supported by the National Democrats (ČND), as well as the minor Czech Traders' Party (ČŽOS) and the far-right National Legionary Community (NOL).\n\nThe Communists, as usual, have nominated their own candidate, but many of the communists may choose to support Beneš as a counter to the far-right bloc forming around Němec. \n\nIn any case, it appears that the end of the Pětka coalition that has governed our country for over a decade may be at hand."
cze.10.a:0 "Elect Masaryk once more!"
cze.10.b:0 "Elect Edvard Beneš!"
cze.10.c:0 "Elect Bohumil Němec!"

czegajda.0.t:0 "The Rebellious Gajda"
czegajda.0.desc:0 "Radola Gajda, a general in the Czech Army, has been a thorn in the side of our government for years. Rumours have swirled around him since the mid-1920s, but as nothing concrete has been found, we have been unable to rid ourselves of him once and for all. \n\nHowever, his involvement with the radical right-wing party, the Národní obec legionářská (NOL) has many in our government worried. He remains popular among many of the old Legionaries, and so manages to hold sway over a significant portion of the army. We must combat his influence to ensure that the army remains under civilian control."
czegajda.0.a:0 "We shall prevail!"
czegajda.1.t:0 "Gajda Speaks Out"
czegajda.1.desc:0 "In flagrant disregard for protocol, Gajda has spoken out publicly against his supsension. He claims that he is being targetted unfairly, and has denounced both the government's actions and the rumours around him being peddled by the press."
czegajda.1.a:0 "How dare he?!"
czegajda.2.t:0 "Gajda Active as Ever"
czegajda.2.desc:0 "Despite our little \"gift\" to him, and its implicit urging for him to retire, Gajda has shown no motion towards doing so. It appears that although he has accepted our \"gift,\" and indeed quieted down for a few weeks, he will continue to actively pursue his military career as well as his involvement with the NOL."
czegajda.2.a:0 "Damn."
czegajda.3.t:0 "Raiding Štít Národa"
czegajda.3.desc:0 "We have raided the offices of Štít Národa, a far-right newspaper that supports Gajda's National Legionary Community (NOL), on charges of conspiring against the government. The evidence we have to support this is tenuous, but it is true that many of their articles have called for the establishment of an anti-liberal government – a proposition that inherently challenges the foundations of our very republic. \n\nWhat measures should we take against them?"
czegajda.3.a:0 "Only search their offices and harass them."
czegajda.3.b:0 "Arrest a few prominent members."
czegajda.3.c:0 "Shut them down permanently!"
czegajda.4.t:0 "Unrest in the Streets"
czegajda.4.desc:0 "A new paramilitary group has arisen in Prague and other cities: Obrana. Although officially, Obrana and the NOL are unaffiliated, Obrana uses much of the same rhetoric and supports many of the same positions as the far-right party, and from what little the police have been able to gather so far, share much of the same membership."
czegajda.4.a:0 "These hooligans are threatening our democracy!"
czegajda.5.t:0 "Dělnická Stráž"
czegajda.5.desc:0 "In order to counter the Obrana paramilitary group, our government has allowed the creation of party-affiliated paramilitary groups. Today the Communist Party announced the formation of one such group, the Dělnická Stráž, or Workers' Guard. Although some fear that this will only serve to strengthen the communists' position, we can only hope that they and the NOL supporters will ultimately make each other impotent."
czegajda.5.a:0 "Two birds with one stone...?"
czegajda.6.t:0 "Anti-Legionary Publications"
czegajda.6.desc:0 "We have decided to sponsor anti-NOL articles in the newspapers, in the hopes of weakening Gajda's popular support while it's still meagre. However, we have to be covert, so we have only a small amount of money put aside for it. We will have to focus our support on a single publication."
czegajda.6.a:0 "The National Socialists' newspaper, České slovo!"
czegajda.6.b:0 "The Social Democrats' newspaper, Právo lidu!"
czegajda.6.c:0 "The Communists' newspaper, Rudé právo!"
czegajda.7.t:0 "NOL Deputies Protest"
czegajda.7.desc:0 "The elected deputies from Gajda's NOL are protesting the shutdown of Štít Národa, their unofficial party newspaper. They're accusing the Pětka coalition of impeding true democracy and stifling freedom of speech."
czegajda.7.a:0 "We have nothing to say."
czegajda.8.t:0 "Clashes in the Streets!"
czegajda.8.desc.aa:0 "Last night, a far-right rally aligned with the NOL turned violent when communist and other left-wing counterprotestors arrived to demonstrate against Legionarism and antisemitism. It's unclear who struck first, but it quickly devolved into a riot. \n\nThe police eventually quelled the riot, but it was a clear tactical victory for the communists."
czegajda.8.desc.ab:0 "When Obrana members marched through the streets last night, they were faced with an impromptu counterprotest made up of communists and other left-wing sympathisers. It's unclear who struck first, but it quickly devolved into a riot. \n\nThe police eventually quelled the riot, but it was a clear tactical victory for the communists."
czegajda.8.desc.ac:0 "When Obrana members marched through the streets last night, they came face-to-face with a group of Dělnická Stráž members who had organised to \"defend workers and Jews from the Legionary menace.\" It's unclear who struck first, but the two groups quickly began fighting through the streets. Gunshots were heard from across the city. \n\nWhile the police worked to contain the clash, Dělnická Stráž emerged victorious."
czegajda.8.desc.ba:0 "Last night, a far-right rally aligned with the NOL turned violent when communist and other left-wing counterprotestors arrived to demonstrate against Legionarism and antisemitism.

Gunshots were heard from across the city. \n\nWhile the police worked to contain the clash, Obrana emerged victorious."
czegajda.8.a:0 "Such violence!"
czegajda.9.t:0 "Gajda Advances his Schemes"
czegajda.9.desc:0 "It seems that Gajda and the NOL have made strides towards consolidating their base of support. We should remain on the lookout, and do whatever we can to squash this movement before it gets out of hand."
czegajda.9.a:0 "Pravda vítězí!"

czecom.0.t:0 "Communists Seize Power in Prague!"
czecom.0.desc:0 "In response to an attempted coup by the troublesome general Radola Gajda, the workers of the Czech Republic took to the streets and occupied the factories. In the chaotic aftermath, both the elected government and the military have fallen into complete disarray, and the Communist Party has unilaterally declared a socialist republic. Enthusiastic workers and trepidatious onlookers flocked to Wenceslas Square today, where—in the very same spot where the independent Czechoslovak Republic was declared only 15 years ago—the Communist leadership promised to lead the country into a grand new future."
czecom.0.a:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"
czecom.0.b:0 "The red tide advances ever further across Europe..."

czefasc.0.t:0 "The Military Regime in Prague, Triumphant"
czefasc.0.desc:0 "Amid news of the military emerging triumphant from clashes in the streets of Prague, President Masaryk has officially resigned. Despite opposition from all quarters—from the Communists, from the parliamentarists, even from within the military itself—General Radola Gajda seems to have decisively consolidated power in the Czech Republic. The question on the world's lips now is: where to from here? The only certainty is that the Czech thorn in the side of its communist neighbours will grow ever more aggressive."
czefasc.0.a:0 "What does this mean for Europe?"

CZE_obrana_fascist_desc:0 "Obrana is the paramilitary arm of the [GetCZEFascistParty], and is firmly under the control of Radola Gajda. Through this essential instrument of the people, the Germans, socialists, and Jews who seek to undermine our nation will be crushed under our boot!"

CZE_delnicka_straz_desc:0 "Dělnická Stráž is a communist paramilitary group that we have allowed to operate, alongside other parties' admittedly smaller paramilitaries, in the hopes of countering Obrana. Although some fear that this will lead to a strengthening of the communists' position, we hope that the clashes between them and Obrana will ultimately weaken both movements."

CZE_revolution_nerf:0 "§RRevolutionary Crisis§!"
CZE_revolution_nerf_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the fascist coup attempt, the legitimacy of the state has broken down. Because of the Communist Party's role in leading the general strike, the factory occupations, and the street demonstrations against fascism, it has emerged as the party with the most authority in Czech society. As time goes on it has become apparent that the Communists will retain and consolidate this position going forward, and they have formed a provisional revolutionary government. In the meantime however, the economy and the armed forces are in disarray.\nOnwards, to the workers' republic!"
CZE_com_nationalised_estates:0 "State Farms"
CZE_com_nationalised_estates_desc:0 "Large estates have all been brought under state ownership, and the farm labourers have been organised into committees that operate the farms collectively. This initiative will no doubt prove to be a shining example of socialist efficiency, surpassing all capitalist methods. However, this also means that many administrative costs have been passed to the state."
CZE_com_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
CZE_com_land_reform_desc:0 "We have sent party activists into the countryside to organise the peasants into committees to facilitate the redistribution of the land.
