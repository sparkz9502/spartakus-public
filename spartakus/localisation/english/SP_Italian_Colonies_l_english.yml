### Ideas ###

INA_Senussi:0 "Senussi Insurgency"
INA_Senussi_desc:0 "Italian North Africa is being terrorized by members of the Senussi Order, a religious clan that inhabits the barren deserts of Libya. While we had granted them autonomy in 1920, they have rallied several of the various clans in Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan to their side and have launched a campaign of banditry, sabotage and murder. The situation has worsened to the point that the entire region has been put under martial law and is now governed by the military and the colonial police. The crippled state of the government at home has limited our ability to crush this threat, and with more trouble on the horizon it seems things can only get worse, not better."
