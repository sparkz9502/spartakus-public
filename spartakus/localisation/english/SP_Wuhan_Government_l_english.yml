### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_WANG_JINGWEI_DESC:0 "§GDate of Birth:§! §g4 May 1883§!\n§GPlace of Birth:§! §gSanshui, Guangdong§!\n§GOverview:§! §gThe young and promising leader of leftists, hero of Xinhai Revolution, trusted and diligent secretary Of Dr.Sun Yat-sen... While Wang is granted with so many halos, the problems that whether he is suitable for his position remains to be a question. With the process of revolution, it seems that the halos cannot cover up the questions on his abilities anymore. \n\n After the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Wang once successfully build up his position by promoting the united front between KMT and CPC. However, when Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Hanmin were trying to challenge his position together with the rightists reluctant to the coalition, Wang could barely defend his position. Luckily, the smooth result of the Northern Expedition and the hasty reactionary coups held by the rightists had saved Wang's fame. When Wuhan successfully united most of, if not all, revolutionaries, reactionaries in Nanjing seemed to be abandoned by the mass, and suffered from heavy loss. Achieving an elegant success, though the future of Wuhan seems to be promising, those questions on whether Wang is a capable leader haunt once again. While the CPC and radical leftists consider the revolution is far less than success, those gentries together with generals and soldiers whose interest was impaired during reforms are clamoring to expel all leftists. \n\n By the year of 1932, Wang has been thrown to a dilemma - to quit the position of leader of KMT would be more like to commit suicide in terms of politics, while to stay in the position means he would have to make bitter decisions that would certainly enrage a certain faction who are able to overthrow him. It is hard to say whether Wang weight the revolutionary ideals more, or he is just concerning how to solidify his position."
