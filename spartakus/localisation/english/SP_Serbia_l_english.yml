SER_SP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Adriatic War was sparked by the Italians supporting the anti-Yugoslav elements in Montenegro, and tore apart the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, splitting it among three states and deposing Alexander from the throne. A short-lived provisional government was created, but it was soon taken back over by royalists and their revanchist militias left over from the Great war. It's been ten years since then, and the royal dictatorship managed by a brute regent has lead to nothing but further stagnation and isolation. Corruption, poverty and crime is rampant, the bitter democratic opposition is radicalizing, and Serbia is on a precipice."

serbia.1.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader] Vidovdan"
serbia.1.d:0 "On June 15 (Julian, Gregorian 28) 1389, an army led by Serbian Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović clashed on Kosovo field with the invading army of the Ottoman Empire, commanded by Sultan Murad Hüdavendigâr. The Ottomans eventually annihilated the Serbian troops, but suffered massive casualties themselves, delaying their conquests. Now, Vidovdan is a Serbian national and religious holiday, commemorating the Saint Prince Lazar and the Serbian holy martyrs who fell during the Battle of Kosovo. This is also the day the Austro-Hungarian archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by Gavrilo Princip, leading up to the Great War, and as such has gained even more national significance."
serbia.1.a:0 "How Eventful"
serbia.3.t:0 "Demands of the Public"
serbia.3.d:0 "The people of Serbia have suffered for too long under the tyranical rule of Pećanac and his gang. The urbanites demand freedom of speech, political organization and suffrage and have campaigned in various underground organizations for years. The majority of the population, subsistence peasants, is concerned with improvement to their living conditions, something the stagnant dictatorship, too concerned with arming itself, can't offer."
serbia.3.a:0 "Change is Coming"
serbia.4.t:0 "May Day Rally in the Garrison"
serbia.4.d:0 "After weeks of protests and riots around the country, mostly by impoverished workers supported by communists, droves of soldiers stationed in Kragujevac have refused to follow orders and keep firing at the protesters. Most of them are young conscripts from lower class families bitter at their inadequate treatment by the government and unwilling to fire at their neighbors. A similar situation is unfolding in some other regional capitals and Belgrade itself, where soldiers have been refusing to aid the police in keeping food riots down.\n\nThis all culminated around May Day, where thousands of soldiers, with nothing to stop them, broke out in protest themselves. The military camp in Kragujevac was torn apart and officers were either shot or sent on the run as soldiers draped the encampment with Serbian tricolors and red flags. A few dozen soldiers loyal to the kingdom, aided by the police, attempted to prevent this gathering, but most of them met the same fate as the officers as they were overwhelmed in numbers. Meanwhile, the protesters in the streets have been emboldened and the factory workers are organizing their own guard independently."
serbia.4.a:0 "Bože pomozi!"
serbia.5.t:0 "First Elections in Serbia"
serbia.5.d:0 "Following our democratic principles, we've approved all legal parties in Serbia to participate in our reborn nation's first elections within the scope of the territory we are currently protecting from counter-revolutionaries. The KPJ has risen in popularity due to the revolutionary fervor in the civil war, but the DS still holds most of the traditional base of support - if we are to allow them to freely contest us, they might win. What happens?"
serbia.5.a:0 "The democrats win!"
serbia.5.b:0 "Maybe this sort of democracy is not what we need..."
serbia.5.c:0 "The KPJ holds on to office, fair and square."
serbia.6.t:0 "Fall of the Belgrade Garrison"
serbia.6.d:0 "Six days after the mutiny in Kragujevac, a similar chain of events unfolded in our capital garrison. After a day of violent struggle in the main camp and executions of dozens of officers as well as at least a few hundred loyalists, Belgrade has effectively fallen out of our control. Fortunately, the royal family as well as the administration has escaped to Niš.\n\nRevolutionaries backed by the communists are now trying to organize a system of councils inspired by the USSR, while the liberal opposition is pushing for a more moderate transitional government. Additionally, Some of the leadership of the KPJ is rumored to be coming back from exile to the anarchy in Belgrae, and it's only a matter of when their return is to accelerates these events into motion."

serbia.6.b:0 "Stand with the Kingdom!"
serbia.7.t:0 "Militants at the Gates"
serbia.8.t:0 "Ex-Democrats Protest the Ban"
serbia.8.d:0 "Several smaller gatherings of the banned parties members took place in our capital during the last couple of days, protesting the sudden shutdown of all opposition to the now only legal KPJ. The gatherings have been without any major incidents, intimidated by the brute strength of the KPJ. What should we do about these fools?"
serbia.8.a:0 "They have the right to do so."
serbia.8.b:0 "Let the milicija deal with them!"
serbia.9.t:0 "Nationalization Completed!"
serbia.9.d:0 "The nationalization plan put in action mere months ago is finally yielding. Many had resisted it at first, but thanks to effective enforcement and a strong political campaign, most of the countrys assets are at our disposal, and the industrial and agricultural sector is running smoother than ever before."
serbia.9.a:0 "Great!"
serbia.10.t:0 "Socialization Completed!"
serbia.10.d:0 "The socialization plan has proven effective over a longer period of time. The basis of it was shaky, but the self-managed industrialists and agrarians, with the transitional government enforcing order, have generally managed to establish a foothold and stabilize the situation. Our economy is now controlled by the proletariat, and we are a step closer to communism."
serbia.10.a:0 "Great!"
serbia.14.t:0 "Kosovars allowed to return"
serbia.14.d:0 "[TUR.GetNameDef] have responded to our request, greenlighting the return of the several hundreds of thousands of Albanian expellees they had been transferred during the last few years."
serbia.14.a:0 "Great!"
serbia.15.t:0 "Request for Repatriation Rejected"
serbia.15.d:0 "[TUR.GetNameDef] have rejected our request, and the expelled Kosovar Albanians will not be allowed to return from their state, for unspecified reasons."
serbia.15.a:0 "Hm!"
serbia.16.t:0 "KPJ Popularizing in Rural Areas"
serbia.16.d:0 "Yugoslav agrarians have been extremely pleased with the transitional government's reforms and support concerning their profession, finally seeing some progress and modernization after so many years of backwater manual labor. Even those who may have not yet been directly affected by it are eagerly awaiting, having heard about unused land being redistributed and new tools, trucks, tractors, and so on being imported and lended from foreign countries."
serbia.16.a:0 "I could go for a shot of rakija..."
serbia.18.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader] Democracy Prevails in Serbia!"
serbia.18.d:0 "A mere few weeks ago, the king of Serbia, under pressure of may day rioters and liberal protesters, has decided to omit most of his powers. Serbia's new constitution will allow freedom of speech, religion, and association, as well as a parliament with elected members. It seems that most are content, except for the communists and Yugoslav nationalists. For the second time in the last twenty years, Serbia is a democracy."
serbia.18.a:0 "Shocking!"
serbia.19.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader] Serbian Opposition Rallies in the North"
serbia.19.d:0 "The great depression has driven years of abject poverty and disastrous hypermilitarization in Serbia over the edge. Due to most of the population completely losing its primary source of income with no market for their agrarian goods, food riots broke out all over the country and chaos raged on for weeks.\n\nAs the gendarmery and the regents guard lost control over the situation, the garrison in Belgrade broke out in revolt supporting a brittle alliance of the communist and liberal opposition.\n\nThe future of the fledgling Serbian republic is uncertain."
serbia.19.a:0 "It was inevitable!"
serbia.20.t:0 "Serbia reimposes Yugoslavia!"
serbia.20.d:0 "The treaty ending the Adriatic War had strictly prohibited Yugoslavia from being reformed and put all lands of the former Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes into the Italian sphere of influence. Now that Serbia has, on it's own volition, decided to declare Yugoslavia once again, we must react decisively. This could make or break our control of the Adriatic."
serbia.20.a:0 "Cut them off and be ready for anything!"
serbia.20.b:0 "Impose sanctions"
serbia.20.c:0 "Who cares about Yugoslavia? We've got Illyria."
serbia.21.t:0 "Yugoslavia Sends an Ultimatum!"
serbia.21.d:0 "Earlier today, we have received an ultimatum from Yugoslavia, demanding immediate suspension of the True People's Party and annexation of the country into the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. The popular pro-Serbian whites movement is torn, as some believe integration into Yugoslavia would also mean integration into Serbia, while many consider it's current administration to be anti-Serb and are therefore opposed to it. On the other hand, the ruling greens are going to vehemently defend Montenegro's independence, and may call for Italian assistance."
serbia.21.a:0 "We better not allow more bloodshed!"
serbia.21.b:0 "Fight for the right, honour and freedom of Montenegro!"
serbia.22.t:0 "Montenegro has Fallen!"
serbia.22.d:0 "Montenegro has been fully annexed into Yugoslavia after accepting their ultimatum. While the Italian army and government has mostly abandoned Montenegro by now, this is still hugely upsetting for the stability in the region, and the Montenegrin king will have to seek refuge elsewhere."
serbia.22.a:0 "Dio mio!"
serbia.23.t:0 "Montenegro Accepts the Ultimatum!"
serbia.23.d:0 "The Montenegrins have agreed to our rather pressuring conditions. Their sovereignity is history now."
serbia.23.a:0 "Excellent!"
serbia.24.t:0 "Montenegro Refuses the Ultimatum!"
serbia.24.d:0 "The Montenegrins have refused our conditions. We are at war now!"
serbia.24.a:0 "Do they really stand a chance?"
serbia.25.t:0 "Portugese Volunteers Returning"
serbia.25.d:0 "Many communist party members had gone to Portugal in order to participate in the civil war, and are opting to return to Yugoslavia with it becoming friendly territory again. One of these proletarian heroes is Žikica Jovanović, nicknamed 'Portugalac' (The Portugese). He is young and idealistic, already confrontational with the more authoritarian members of our party, but will make for a great leader of our armies with his proven strategic brilliance."
serbia.25.a:0 "Did he walk his way here?"
serbia.26.t:0 "Yugoslavia is Threatening us!"
serbia.26.d:0 "Ever since the fall of the kingdom, we've been expecting reformed Yugoslavia to strike. Today seems to be the day, as Yugoslav worker's militias and other irregular armed forces have been amassing at our border, some rumors say even breaking into villages just over the Drina, looting and fortifying defensible positions. Sightings and accusations of communist cell members and terrorists planning attacks, clearly informed by their masterminds in Belgrade, stretch as far as Zagreb itself. The last straw has been drawn..."
serbia.26.a:0 "It's time to end this vile product of bolshevism!"
serbia.26.b:0 "We'll fight on our own!"
serbia.27.t:0 "A Shattered Retreat"
serbia.27.d:0 "We have been embarassingly defeated in the field of battle by a far inferior enemy. The Italians and Illyrians fought valiantly side by side, but the militant communist horde has pushed us back, nearly even into the Italian mainland. It's better to stop this bloodshed before we lose even more of our men..."
serbia.27.a:0 "Our hands are tied"
serbia.28.t:0 "Send Volunteers to Croatia and Bosnia?"
serbia.28.d:0 "The anti-Italian organizations within Illyria have finally rise up against their oppressors. While many within the revolters, especially the far-right 'Croatian Revolutionary Movement' aren't exactly friendly to us, the bulk of the movement has good relations with Serbia. A similar situation is in Bosnia, although efforts by chetniks to quash Serbian and Croatian autonomists could lead to more tensions within the nation. Currently, their collective paramilitary forces are overwhelming to the barebones Illyrian guard, but they could certainly use our help, even if only to bring them closer to us. Some are hinting at a Yugoslav reunion..."
serbia.28.a:0 "Absolutely! Send them our men."
serbia.29.t:0 "Serbia's Economy"
serbia.29.d:0 "Serbia, having suffered long periods of foreign rule, has come to be severely underedeveloped at the turn of the century. While there were some efforts to address this unfortunate state of affairs, they were interrupted by a series of wars decades ago and a long period of instability that followed. The most dramatic were the Great War, in which Serbia was completely destroyed infrastructurally and industrially, and the Adriatic War, in which it lost much of its territory and was cut off from the rest of the world without its most important trading partners in the west (now Illyria and Montenegro).\n\nWorst of all, the state struggles with a poor management of funds, administered by nationalist opportunists and kleptocrats, as well as rampant corruption. As such, Serbia has been in a constant downturn for quite some time. The lower strata of our society have been increasingly restless, with declining incomes and increasing shortages in basic goods. Any more pressure could set off bread riots, or worse."
serbia.29.a:0 "How unfortunate."
serbia.30.t:0 "The Great Depression Hits Serbia"
serbia.30.d:0 "Serbia, already impoverished, has been impacted strongly bt he crash of the New York Stock Exchange, particularly in the agrarian sector. With no one to sell goods to, Serbian agrarians are failing to subside for themselves, and it seems like the entire country is tearing apart, with food riots intensifying and army regulars joining in or protecting protesters from the police.\n\nMeanwhile, nationalist chetnik militias, despite their decline in membership, are preparing a defence for the king and Pećanac, the 'regent'. The reinforced garrison in Belgrade has been ordered to disperse any meetings and shoot immediately at any protesters that are armed or bearing red flags."
serbia.30.a:0 "How will we contain them without the army?"
serbia.31.t:0 "Tito Leads the Workers"
serbia.31.d:0 "The notorious Croatian communist, Josip Broz Tito, has seized the opportunity and led the paramilitary of the Croatian branch of the KPJ into contact with our command. His leadership and troops are now available to us."
serbia.31.a:0 "Druže Tito!"
serbia.32.t:0 "Victory!"
serbia.32.d:0 "The last units of the Italian imperialist forces are being driven away into their homeland. Columns of Italian soldiers which were encircled or couldn't cross the Italian border, including much of the Illyrian guard, were left as POWs, and many are being taken to labor camps or have been summarily executed by our forces. Italian communities along the coast are also being expelled, often brutally.\n\nBesides the chaos near the frontlines, nationalists within Yugoslavia are not taking the new leadership well, and many are being detained. Thousands more may lose their lives in these trying times, as conflict continues within our nation."
serbia.32.a:0 "The worst is over"
serbia.33.t:0 "Montenegrin Reaction"
serbia.33.d:0 "Pavle Đurišić, a Montenegrin Serb and former Yugoslav officer who distinguished himself helping us lead troops against the Italians in the last war, had turned after refusing many of our orders and even terrorizing non-Serb groups. Since then, Đurišić and his chetnik band have been hiding from our security forces in rural Montenegro. With the recent attacks on Montenegrin chieftains, they've seized the opportunity to attack again."
serbia.33.a:0 "Get them!"
serbia.34.t:0 "Invite Bulgaria?"
serbia.34.d:0 "Both the governments of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia are currently primarily proponents of unification. While Bulgaria is a lot more torn on the issue, starting diplomatic talks is a worthwile cause."
serbia.34.a:0 "Send them a proposal"
serbia.34.b:0 "We don't need them!"
serbia.35.t:0 "Yugoslavia Proposes Unification"
serbia.35.d:0 "Bulgaria falls into most definitions of a complete Yugoslavia, but it has never been part of a pan-Yugoslav nation. This could change soon, as Yugoslavia has proposed unification to us. The communists in charge generally support this, but Bulgarian nationalists within the masses are strongly opposing them. What shall the leadership choose?"
serbia.35.a:0 "Brotherhood and unity!"
serbia.35.b:0 "Politely decline"
serbia.38.t:0 "Join the Comintern?"
serbia.38.d:0 "The Comintern is currently the closest to us ideologically. Should we enter a pact with them, or remain neutral?"
serbia.38.a:0 "Send an offer to the Comintern"
serbia.38.b:0 "Remain neutral"
serbia.39.t:0 "Yugoslavia Offers to Join the Comintern"
serbia.39.d:0 "Yugoslavia has offered to join our alliance in exchange for mutual diplomatic and military support. With the establishment of official relations with this formerly unrecognized nation, the light of socialism shines into the Balkans."
serbia.39.a:0 "Excellent"
serbia.40.t:0 "Yugoslavia is Threatening us!"
serbia.40.d:0 "Ever since the fall of the kingdom, we've been expecting reformed Yugoslavia to strike.

serbia.40.a:0 "Help!"
serbia.41.t:0 "Victory"
serbia.41.d:0 "The last remnants of our enemies sovereign military formations are being quashed as the flag of socialist Yugoslavia finally flies over Ljubljana, Zagreb and Sarajevo, all the major capitals in the region.\n\nThe last strongholds of independent chetniks in Herzegovina, Muslim Legionnaires in the mountains of Bosnia, and the radical HRP holed up all over Croatia will soon fall with the finalizing military operations of the liberatory army. Thousands of more dangerous actors within the country will be detained in these trying times."
serbia.41.a:0 "The worst is over"
serbia.42.t:0 "Chaos in the South"
serbia.42.d:0 "The units that remain loyal to the monarchy, as well as chetnik militias, have prepared their defence in a few cities in the south of Serbia as well as Loznica in the west. Meanwhile, remantns of the the Albanian kachaks that have been partly suppressed some years ago by the chetnik government are organizing the local administration to combat the violent anticommunist insurgence targetting them alongside communists, as well as using the opportunity to splinter off the government in Belgrade."
serbia.42.a:0 "Fight for the revolution!"
serbia.42.b:0 "Fight for the kingdom!"
serbia.42.c:0 "Fight for Albanian people!"
serbia.43.t:0 "Diplomacy from Croatia"
serbia.43.d:0 "Croatia's liberal government has proposed closer diplomatic ties and cultural exchange to us. This could certainly prevent future cultural animosity, but the question is whether or not we desire that."
serbia.43.a:0 "Wholeheartedly accept"
serbia.43.b:0 "Hm..."
serbia.44.t:0 "Macedonian Communists Join Us!"
serbia.44.d:0 "Veles has long been a stronghold of our party in the south and the section headquartered in it has voted to organize an armed struggle against the monarchy. The city itself is already organizing its own councils and red guard, but we could perhaps support them in order to gain a quick advantage."
serbia.44.a:0 "Good! But let's focus on the northern front for now."
serbia.44.b:0 "Immediately send them support! Arm more!"

serbiair.3.d:0 "The show our pilots put up tonight went without any complications, but could only be described as somewhat boring. It seems that a poor roster of pilots along with a very sparse selection of planes diverted to the race did not yield in the most exciting event."

serbiair.4.t:0 "Air Race Ends in Catastrophe!"
serbiair.4.d:0 "The race began with the bombast that was expected of it - but the mood suddenly swung downwards as the new Rogožarski IK-3 piloted by Radovan Gavrilović suddenly steered out of control due to an engine piston penetrating the block, the toxic fumes released incapacitating Gavrilović. The IK-3 crashed into a nearby fighter piloted by Andrej Domaćin, culminating in a mid-air explosion. Fortunately, no one but the two killed pilots was injured, but the shock this incident will bring to morale is dramatic."

SER_KPJ_description:0 "§GFoundation:§! 1919\n§GIdeology:§! Leninism, Marxism, Yugoslavism\n\n§GDescription:§! When the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created after World War I, the different social democratic parties that had existed in Austria-Hungary, Serbia and Montenegro called for a unification of their parties. The idea was widely accepted by parties and organizations from all over the country and in April 1919 a Congress of Unification was held in Belgrade, attended by 432 delegates representing 130,000 organized supporters of the workers’ class movement from all parts of the Kingdom except Slovenia. After the Adriatic War, Yugoslavia was torn apart by Italy, and the KPJ has been subsequently banned in Illyria, Serbia and Montenegro. It remains underground, but growing in power as the people become weary of Illyrian and Serbian despots."

In the Spring of 1919, in Sarajevo, the State Party of Serbian, Croatian and Slovene Democrats (Serbian: Државотворна странка демократа Срба, Хрвата и Словенаца, Državnotvorna stranka demokrata Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca) is created by a merger of the Yugoslav Democratic Party with Serbian and Croatian liberal parties, namely the Independent Radical Party, the Serbian Progressive Party and the People's Party. The elected president of the party was Ljubomir Davidović, also a president of the Assembly and a mayor of Belgrade. The party won the largest number of deputies in the first elections held in 1920: they could occupy 92 of the 419 seats in the constituent assembly. While rather popular in Serbia, with strict voter and minority intimidation, its been out of government as the state became more and more authoritarian, eventually turning Serbia into a personal dictatorship."

#start
SER_The_Decade_of_Silence:0 "Perpetual State of Emergency"
SER_The_Decade_of_Silence_desc:0 "After the Great War, a majority of Montenegrins supported the unification with other Southern Slavs on a federal basis. However, the "Greens" faction of the National Assembly, supporting a confederation rather than a centralized monarchy ruled from Belgrade, rose up against the pro-Serbian government as it was in the process of unification, leading up to a Italian intervention. Already in ruins due to the Great War, the fledgling Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was swiftly decimated. Core Serbia itself was harshly afflicted, losing all newly gained territory and even Sandžak as part of the peace treaty. Italy forced the abdication of the king, and Serbia had to form a provisional democratic government. The first transitional president, Ivan Ribar of the Democratic Party, was quickly forced to resign under accusations of being a foreign impostor. Chetnik militia leaders that fought both in the Adriatic War and the Great War used the opportunity to coup the government, with strengthened support for their revanchist ideas. The new Pećanac government successfully subdued dissent in the first few years of its rule, promising to take back Sandžak and more lost territories. It has been a decade since the coup, and with their promises not having amounted to anything, the standard of living collapsing due to economic recession and a careless push for militarization, support is tumbling down rapidly. At the start of 1932, it seems like the radical vanguard of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia is posing most of a threat to the regime, with strong support from neighboring communist states. Serbia is on very thin ice."

SER_Decree_on_the_Colonization_of_the_Southern_Regions_desc:0 "The Decree on the Colonization of the Southern Provinces is a programme implemented by the Kingdom of Serbia in order to alter the ethnic population of Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia by settling it with Serbs, and even expulsing the native population into the Ottoman Sultanate. It has proven to be generally unsuccessful, as few are willing to settle in Kosovo, but the government is stubborny enforcing it anyways, leading to even more tensions in the south..."
