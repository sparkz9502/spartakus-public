### Ideas ###

RAJ_deindustrialization:0 "Deindustrialization"
RAJ_deindustrialization_desc:0 "Ever since the conquest of India in the late 1700’s, the British have actively strived to strangle the regions economy and have succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. India is heavily dependent on Britain for the import of manufactured goods, and the Raj cannot prop itself up when faced with an economic crisis. Native industry is dead, and the lands that once contributed a quarter of the world’s GDP are stripped bare of any modern economic machines. The Raj is heavily dependent on its agricultural sector, preventing the exploitation of its huge population."
RAJ_martial_races_policy:0 "The 'Martial Races' Policy"
RAJ_martial_races_policy_desc:0 "After the 1857 Mutiny, the British Raj has instated a clear policy of favouring the races that supported them during the Sepoy war. The Jats, Sikhs, Baluchis, Pathans, Marathas, Qareshis, Gurkhas and Rajputs form the core of the Indian Army, excluding huge swathes of potential manpower. However, the Indian Army is more professionalized due to its small size. The army has also been restricted by the Presidency system, preveting the full movement of troops outside their home presidency."
RAJ_red_revolt_scars:0 "Scars of the Red Revolt"
RAJ_red_revolt_scars_desc:0 "The Red Revolt of 1926-1928 was a turning point in the Raj’s history. The Presidency armies were unable to keep up with the large bandit movement, and it was only due to the vast efforts of the Princely states that the revolt was crushed. The army is filled with those who remember the screams in the middle of the night as their brothers-in-arms were attacked by raiders."
RAJ_export_boom:0 "Export Boom"
RAJ_export_boom_desc:0  "After the London Crash of 1929, the Raj has exceeded expectations and coped well with the economic downturn. Industrialization of the Princely states, a small middle class, a large captive market and a strong agricultural harvest provide the perfect environment for an economic boom, but should the farms fail, the effects may be dire."
