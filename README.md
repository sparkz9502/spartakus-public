# Spartakus: World in Revolution
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wgE6wgi.png" width="300"/>

## Summary

Spartakus is a Hearts of Iron IV modification revolving around an alternative history where the German Revolution and various other socialist revolutions succeed following the Great War. The goal is to create a semi-realistic representation of how the world would be in such an alternative history, while still providing a fun, narrative-driven, innovative experience. Following a series of divergences in late-1918, the newly-founded Communist Party of Germany (KPD) maintains its alliance with the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) and participates in elections to the Weimar National Assembly. As such, the disorganized revolts that occurred historically in early 1919 never take place, with a well-coordinated nationwide revolution instead taking place in May 1919. Following a brutal civil war in which the Bolsheviks intervene, the socialists emerge victorious and establish the Free Socialist Republic of Germany.

The success of the revolution sends shockwaves throughout the world. The lack of the Treaty of Versailles and reparations leaves both France and Britain economically devastated and unable to repay their debts to the United States, weakening the British Empire and enabling the rise of a military dictatorship in France. The United States isolates itself from the world economy, shielding itself from the effects of the catastrophic 1929 London Market Crash. With 1932 arriving and distinct power blocs forming, it is now not a matter of if but rather when another war will erupt.
